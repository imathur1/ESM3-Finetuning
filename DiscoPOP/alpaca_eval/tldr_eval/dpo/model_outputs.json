We were in secret because my parents are (racist?) in the way that they only want me to date people from an Asian background like me, and she is white. Eventually, because our school is super small and rumors spread like crazy, the staff found out maybe about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even had to use generic words like \"girlfriend and her mom\" instead of saying names to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends, no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this, and it's very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school administration has said things such as, \"She's in a lower social class, he can do better,\" \"She's bringing his grades down\" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my parents have also said things such as \"She's white trash,\" and \"She's a gold digger,\" I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven't even spoken to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I'm not sure what to do. Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies for the next year if I get caught? Do I  make arrangements to get back together in a year? Or Do I just give up and accept it as over? All of this stress is really getting to me, and I  have no idea what the best choice is.

When she came back, she said she was going to bed, but being the last day of our vacation, I didn't want to leave then, and I still had my clothes on, so I just said we'd finish playing. \n\nI really regret not leaving with her, but I thought everything would be fine as I was still fully clothed. It was an error of judgement. \n\nHe starts getting touchy-feeley and makes me take my top of, which, regretfully, I did. Then he starts trying to get me to have sex with him. I refuse. He starts trying to get me to give him a handjob. I sort of pat it. He trys to put it between my tits but I'm moving away. \n\nAt this point the door busts open and it's my friend. He springs away like a bolt of lightening, which I thought then made the situation look worse. She said she'd forgotten her purse and leaves straight away. Only last week my friend tells me she'd returned to our room crying and saying she'd caught me giving him head. \n\nNow I don't know what to do. It was a while ago, so I don't just want to randomly bring it up out of no-where, but we were pretty good friends, and the last thing I want is to ruin it because of all this. I know I was in the wrong staying, but in fairness it was the sort of holiday where nakedness and psudo-sexual acts were common-place.\n\nTL;DR:",

This lasted about six months and he even left his wife, at least partially for her.

She refuses to go into detail saying she doesnt want to hurt me. \n\nI cant change what happened and actually dont think I really want to know the extent. She said she is sorry for what happened but doesnt take full responsibility and partially blames what happened on my long work hours and work stress which she says affected our relationship. We had a very rough patch but she eventually ended contact and they no longer work together. We had our second child after that, but things have never been the same. \n\nWe hardly ever have sex (about once every 4 to 5 months) because she says that she doesnt have any libido and has also suffers with very bad dyspareunia. She is pretty affectionate but she resists any physical advances from my side and says that she needs more time. She has been seeing a gynecologict for over a year but things are not better. \n\nI am at my wits end. We used to have great sex, about twice a week at least. I cant help but think that there is more going on. We have tried therapy but things are not better. I have considered hiring a PI to follow her and find out if something else is up.

Where one person has more benefit than the other? Well I've only had one of these and it so happens to be with my \"best friend\". I've always been there for her, when she got pregnant and aborted, when she got pregnant again and delivered her baby, every time she has had issues with her baby daddy, you get the point. She's been there for me too but for some reason every time we hang out we always talk about her and her problems. She asks general questions about what goes on in my life but nothing too deep. I love her because we've been friends since we were 13 years old. But I'm tired of being a GREAT friend to her when she is barely a friend to me. We've both talked about this (because I brought it up) and even cried about it. We decided we'd try to be more involved in each other's lives but nothing has changed. I'm pretty tired of it because I feel used and I really don't benefit much from this friendship. \n\nSo now getting to my question. Her family loves me. I've never been a bad influence on her, I've been a great friend to her and they see that I love her and her baby.  That's what her sister told me when she asked me to be her bridesmaid last year. Her sister and I get along well and knowing that her list of friends is short I felt bad and told her yes.  Now that we are getting ready to buy bridesmaid dresses and my relationship with my \"best friend\" hasn't gotten better I'm kind of thinking of backing out of this. I know her sister is not at fault here but I don't know if I'd feel comfortable being a bridesmaid anymore. Should I talk to the sister\/bride? Should I have another talk with my \"best friend\"?

I get to do what I love, in a killer place, but I don't really make a lot of money considering the field I'm in.  I work in a non-profit museum institution doing video production, and AV technical support as a secondary element to the job.  My salary is barely ok for an entry level position in my field (~30K), even though the work I've been doing up until this point is quite beyond entry level imo, but that's neither here nor there.  \n\nMy predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.  While I agree I do want to keep making creative videos, I'm weary that they're going to try and dump his work load (relatively little in comparison) on top of mine with a minimal raise.  There is very much a rank non-profit culture here, very top heavy, and upward mobility is notoriously difficult (just as a caveat to anyone who might understand the particulars).  \n\nAnd so my question is, how do I figure out in a cordial and non-confrontational way how much is fair for them to offer me for the promotion with additional responsibilities?  I realize I could just ask my current boss how much he's making but that doesn't seem proper or legit, plus he's been here for 20 years so they can always pull the seniority card.

So, I have been an athlete my whole life, started competitive soccer and other sports when I was 5 (27 now), and have always considered myself physically fit. About 4 years ago, I moved to Hawaii and basically became a beach potato with almost no consistent physical activity for the first time in my life. A year and a half ago, I had a baby with my fiance, moved back to the Mainland, and decided I needed to get my life on track for the benefit of my child (now children). So I quit smoking tobacco and signed up for a half marathon. I was doing my best to follow a training program I found on Garmin Connect, but about 8 weeks into the training I started pushing too hard, running too many miles too fast, a classic rookie maneuver, I know, but it felt so good to build strength in my body and I began to rely on the peaceful solace I found running alone, away from the chaos of raising now 2 small children. Anyway, after a nice long run, a hot shower and a nap, I squatted slightly to pick up my son, and I felt a *pop* in my 2nd toe on my left foot. It swelled immediately, and was painful to walk on, let alone run, for (the past) 6-7 weeks, and although MUCH improved this past 2 weeks, I still feel it occasionally. I did some research and I think it may be either Metatarsalgia or Capsulitis, the symptoms match both somewhat. So my questions are these: would it be stupid to try and run again before the symptoms completely dissipate? and when I do start running again, what mileage is safe? Should I start with a c25k (really don't want to be re-injured)? I was running 5-6 miles 4 days a week, with a long run about 8 miles, again, from not running in years in about an 8-10 week span.\nThanks for the help, and all the inspiration and motivation!

And back then we weren't particularly close friends, but we hung out with the same group of people. We weren't close not due to a lack of connection, but rather because I was close friends with different people than she was.\n\nWhat would be the best way to get in touch? I was thinking of just sending a message once I move to meet up for a drink to catch up as I'd like to make some friends in the new place, but I'm concerned that might be a bit questionable as I have plenty of friends in the city already so why would I be contacting her. Admittedly she can't know this, but because the city is so big and central it is highly unlikely I wouldn't have closer friends there already. Any help would be appreciated.

Basically, I was with a guy for a bit over three years (August 2007-October 2010) and our relationship was excellent, but then he got offered an internship that meant that he had to move away for a year. We decided our relationship was so excellent that we would be able to handle long distance for a year. \n\nI moved apartments (we had lived together before - couldn't afford rent on my own), and became friends with this guy that lived across the hall. Over the next six months I steadily started falling for him, and realized I wasn't being \"emotionally faithful\" to the first guy anymore, so I ended it when he came home for Thanksgiving in October (we're Canadians).  \n\nIn December, I started dating the new guy that lived across the hall. Since we basically lived in the same apartment, we got to be together all the time and that was definitely fun...\n\nBut then, in February, my mom got diagnosed with cancer and I had to move home to help her out for a few months (Parents are divorced, I'm an only child).  My new guy decided that he would be okay with long distance, since I'd be moving back in May (hopefully). \n\nTwo weeks ago, he broke up with me because he wasn't feeling it anymore.\n\nThe problem is now that I'm just really angry with myself for throwing away my relationship with my old guy for this new one.

I know I should just chalk it up to \"life experience\" or whatever, but I'm having a hard time doing that. Advice for getting over myself?

Not just *something* burning, but it smelled like cigarette butts burning. I had recently smoked a cigarette on the back porch and outside the basement door, so I went to check. Nothing happening on the back porch, but there was a softball size glowing red wad of cigarette butts where I put my cigarette out about 10-15 minutes earlier. I realize now how unsafe our \"ash tray\" is now because it is just a flimsy plastic thing that a plant would come in, it was over stuffed with cigarette butts AND it was sitting in a bed of pine straw!

I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:\nEach summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech\/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.\n\nSo, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.\n\nOK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.

This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. \n\nThis then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).\n\nThe ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). \n\nHowever I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. \n\nHence I ask, \"Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social\/political revolution?\"\n\nWhen I ask this I do not want the opinion of \"people\" or \"society at large\". I am wondering how you personally feel about taking on such an endeavor.\n\nTL;DR:",

After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like \"You owe me chips,\" as a friendly gesture.\n\nAgain, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like \"You owe me chips!\" and she would say \"No, you owe me chips wtf.\" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.\n\nThe next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.\n\nI walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me. I had no game in high school as you can tell by my previous posts.\n\nTL;DR:",

So I've been dating my current girlfriend since this past August and things have been great. I've actually known her for 3 years but when we tried dating when I was 17 and she was 20, her mom was having none of that so obviously things didn't last very long. So, 3 years later and we're trying again, this time with her mother's approval and her father's approval, or so we thought. Last night my girlfriend's dad gave her a long winded conversation of basically why he doesn't like me, how apparently he thinks I'm not going anywhere in life (to be fair I'm only a student in my 2nd year of Architecture technology, not sure where he got that idea from), he also said I don't talk to him enough when he's never really tried to make conversation with me and says I don't look him in the eye which I have, not sure where that's coming from either, point is he doesn't like me. She mostly thinks it has to due with him being raised by an abusive father, for he kept saying to her well I would never bring a girl to my house when I was your age, which my girlfriend said to me she wouldn't have either if she lived in that house. On a side, my girlfriend has cerebrallypalsy affecting the right side of her brain but its an extremely mild case. The only things she can't really do is drive and cut her own food and other two handed tasks that most people take for granted. So I guess because of this her parents are a little bit more protective. But last night my girlfriend's Father also compared her to her older brother and older sister, saying he never had to deal with any of this from them, (neither of them have any disabilities) so my girlfriend got pretty upset and doesn't know what to do. She wants to move out but her mom won't let  her. I say they shouldn't have it both ways but I'm worried they're going to make her dump me regardless.\n\nTL;DR:",

I took it on, and because I was so new, I didn't know about or use the time tracking tools Elance has built in to guarantee payment. I know, stupid of me, but so it goes. Over two weeks I wrote about 30 articles for him.\n\nSo I turned in my invoice and, surprise, I never got paid. Elance said since I hadn't used their time tracking tools, all they could do was give me contact information. I tried and got nothing -- no surprise, since all they had was an email address and a fake phone number. So that was a dead end.\n\nBut I was able to identify and reach some of the webmasters who had originally commissioned the articles, and one told me he'd bought it from someone on Fiverr. I talked to the Fiverr person and she said she'd outsourced it to a friend (uh huh) and had no idea it was stolen. She refused to tell me who she'd outsourced it to. I suspect she probably resold most, if not all, of my stolen work. Unfortunately, Fiverr doesn't seem to have a way to see what jobs someone has done, so that seems to be another dead end.\n\nI guess my question is, is there any point in reporting to Fiverr? Are there other legal steps I could take? Or do I just need to move on and eat the losses?\n\nI'm in Virginia. The person who hired me claims to be in California but who knows if that's true.\n\nTL;DR:",

Two weeks ago though I learned my mother is moving to another town (we'll call it Town X) about 1.5hours away and has said I can come live with her.

Physically  John is exactly my type, and he's very intelligent with a great sense of humor (we bonded over Reddit funny enough). Because I'm attracted to John I made sure the few times we've hung out it's been in a group and I haven't put myself in any situations that could lead to something (like drinking with him). My attitude about it up until now has been \"Oh well. Crushes happen, but I have a boyfriend.\" Since I told John I'll be moving up to Town X, we've been talking a lot more though. I also learned where I'm moving to will be 10-15minutes away from where he lives. He's also the only person I know up in Town X, and we'll probably be going to the same school in the Spring, so I feel like we're going to spend a lot of time together.

The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk\/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule?

We didn't live together, and we both had hectic days so I guessed that this was the reason for our lack of sex. Three weeks ago we moved together. This was big for me. I thought that now we could start working on our dead bedroom. Unfortunately we only had sex one time the first week. I just thought that was because she was stressed out. So was I. The next week she got her period, so that kind of killed the sex part.\n\nSo, yesterday she was really sad. And I asked what was wrong. She then confessed to me that she had been having an affair with her friend. She haven't told me how long this has been happening, but it seems like it has been going on for a while.\n\nThe worst thing is that I was sickly jealous at her friend. And I was really paranoid that there was something going on. So I confronted her, but she told me that I didn't need to worry.

I tell him that he can hang out with her because she doesn't know we were once in a relationship, but it hurts me a lot to see them together.

Got back together 5 years later, now have been together 2 years and living together for 5 months. \n\nThe problem: I don't know if I want to stay in the relationship. \n\nHere's why: \nI recently came to terms with the fact that I'm an alcoholic (sober 4 months). I also have bipolar disorder (medication\/therapy managed). My father died 6 months ago and that sent me into kind of a tailspin. I then moved across the state to be with boyfriend and closer to my mom, and started a new job (which I love). I've been away from therapy for a few months due to this transition. Adjusting to living with boyfriend has not been easy...I require more space\/alone time than he does, and once you live with someone all the things that bugged you about them before become more pronounced. All this to say that I've been more moody\/touchy\/unstable than I was for the past year. Previously I had been ready to get married and spend my life with this guy, then about a month into living together it's like everything changed out of nowhere. And now I'm avoiding sex with him like the plague and sometimes the thought makes me physically ill. Confession: I started to develop feelings for someone else and I'm not quite sure if it's because he has been helping me in early sobriety or if it's more than that. Anyway, the point is that I now have some good days\/weeks where I feel like my old self and am ready to marry this guy again, other weeks I can't stand him. I feel guilty because I'm the one who cheated years ago, then I'm the one who begged him to take me back, so how could I leave after that?? So there's a lot of shit going on and I don't know where I'm at or what I should do. I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nTL;DR:",

I have been with my bf for 2.5 years and he has been friends with this person since high school. My problem is that when I am hanging out with my bf and his friend, the friend will be extremely touchy with me.

Before this happened the friend did not act like this or make sexual comments. This is the first time he has acted like this towards me and it makes me feel very awkward. When he does these things I either tell him to stop, ask my bf to tell him to stop, or just get up and move somewhere else.

When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it.

I avoid eye contact until she's a couple yards away, and by that time I look up to say hi, but she thinks I'm not going to so she walks past looking the other way.\n\nAgain, that has happened a couple times.

I decided to go in for the kill. I said \"Name of girl... Hey!\", waved again, gave a goofy grin, kind of laughed, and made my turn onto another sidewalk in a different direction, cringing and making faces not knowing if I should've just ignored her again. \n\nFor what it's worth, she was with a friend, said \"hey!\", gave a big grin, chuckled a little bit and waved.\n\nWHAT ON EARTH do you think she was thinking throughout all of this...

We received an email from our wedding coordinator informing us that it was time to choose an officiant from the service (All Seasons) that is on contract with our venue. We went to their website and selected an officiant that really jumped out at both of us and submitted their web form, formally requesting him. A week later we received an email from them saying, \"[Venue] has contacted us to say you are getting married there. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, it's time to pick an officiant and confirm all of these details regarding the location, date, time, and overall vibe of your ceremony.\" I replied back saying I had already been in contact to request an officiant and I answered ALL of her questions, and said that we were still in the process of confirming our ceremony time and that I would let her know ASAP. The next day I emailed again to confirm ceremony time, and within ten minutes I received a reply from her saying, \"Thanks for confirming your ceremony time, can you answer everything else now?\" Uhm, I already did. So I replied back answering all of her questions again and reiterating our interest in this one specific officiant. Three days go by and I receive ANOTHER email from her saying, \"Great, now all that is left to do is confirm your ceremony time and we can check if the officiant you want is available.\" Arg! I just don't understand why they can't pay attention to the things that I've emailed them. Should I send back one email reconfirming all information start to finish? I think if I get another email asking me any of the same questions again I'm going to go nuclear. How hard is it?

After my ex I went on a bit of a spree, seeing a couple of girls, none of which I developed feelings for, although they did for me. I did \"try\" to see if I just wasn't realizing that I had feelings for them, but honestly there was no chemistry. I enjoyed that for a while because I was enjoying someone's company (hanging out, having sex) without the fear or going through the pain I did prior in my first relationship. I know now that the spree was a bit childish, and I regret continuing with those girls although I didn't feel anything, but I've definitely grown, and it's brought me to a relationship where I'm feeling feelings I've never felt - I'm so relieved I actually am feeling these things again, and in even greater magnitude. \n\nMy issue is this; my first relationship, I wasn't scared of living through the end of it because I didn't know what heartbreak was, I had no context and thus no fear of an end. Currently, I'm so very much in love, I have a consistent fear of reliving the pain that I did in the past when my last relationship ended, and even more so because given how in love I am currently, I'm afraid the sadness of the heartbreak will also be greater in magnitude as well.\n\nIs this normal? I know i'm being too much of a pessimist, I really don't think this relationship is going to end anytime soon, but I too frequently think in worst case scenario\n\nTL;DR:",

You mentioned that you know there needs to be a change, but you're not sure where to start.\n\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that your clinginess and temper might be a result of underlying emotional issues and self-esteem problems. Consider seeking professional help to work on these issues and improve your overall well-being.\n\nSecondly, it might be helpful to communicate with your boyfriend and express your desire to be a better partner for him. Ask him for feedback on how you can improve and be more understanding of his needs.\n\nLastly, if you both agree that a break might be necessary for you to focus on your personal growth, it might be worth considering. However, make sure to have clear communication and boundaries in place to prevent any misunderstanding or miscommunication.\n\nIn summary, it's important to prioritize your personal growth and work on improving your relationship with your boyfriend by recognizing underlying issues, seeking professional help, and having open communication.",

After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!\n\nAnd I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit.

We have been together for 2.5 years and the past few times we have hung out, we have not had sex or he rebuffed my advances. He chalked it up to low energy and stress a few things which I understood, but it just felt very off. Not only could I not recall when we were having sex but when we did it wasn't good at all.

That threw me off, but I let it go because I assumed he was joking. However, the very next day we were recalling the previous night's session and how much he enjoyed it. I casually brought up the sex slave comment.

There are two aspects to this: will it help us in the way I think it will, and are there other ways to obtain similar benefits as a married couple has. \n\nThe thought process: \nPrimarily, my husband just graduated college in December with nearly $100,000 in loans, about half through Sallie Mae. I did not cosign on any of these. Since he has not found a job as of yet and only has a couple months left before repayment begins, the thought is that if we remain married, they will a) consider my income when evaluating deferment or income-based repayment, and b) hold me liable for the loans after a certain time period (10 years, I believe?). If we divorce now, my income -should- no longer be considered in repayment and I won't be held accountable for the loans since they were entirely his, entirely used for his tuition, and I have received no benefit.\n\nYes, I know our taxes will go up, but I'm guessing not the $800 - $1000 a month his payments will be.\n\nAdditionally, at the moment he is carried on my insurance because Covered California counts my income and it makes him ineligible. If we divorce, theoretically he could then qualify for subsidized insurance, possibly at a lower cost than my coverage. \n\nIf this is correct and we decide to divorce, are there other documents we can have to ensure certain benefits - Power of attorney, medical rights, etc. I know tax rates and insurance aren't possible to affect, but what other documents can serve to ensure we have rights to make hospitalization\/medical decisions and financial decisions should the need arise?\n\nTL;DR:",

For some reason whenever I am conversing with someone my mind switches into problem solving mode or I start telling a story that will somehow make it seem like I relate to them.  Whatever they are talking about my mind starts clunking away at it and then I spurt out a logical solution.  This works great if they are seeking my advice (so I'm awesome at the workplace) but it's absolutely terrible when say a pretty lady or a friend is sharing some intimate details with me and I can't keep my trap shut long enough to let them adequately tell the story so we can make a connection of some sort.\n\nRight now I'm slowly (very slowly) getting better at biting my tongue when talking to the opposite sex and also realizing that most people don't want their problems solved, they just want to talk and for you to understand.\n\nSo my question to you ladies and gentlemen is, what tips can you give me on becoming a better listener?

On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.\n\nHowever I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:\n\na) Am not really that interested in her. \n\nb) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. \n\nc) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.\n\nd) Am growing up\/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.\n\ne) All of the above\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm a pretty confident, outgoing woman and have asked out men on several occasions. I don't tend to be too shy if I really want something, however, can be in some situations. \n\nI was at the grocery store today at lunch time and was waiting in line to check out. There was a woman who was having difficulty checking out with her multiple credit cards and people in line were noticeably getting impatient. There were two people in front of me in line, and the person directly in front of me was a very cute guy. Sometimes in these situations people kind of glance around to others waiting for visual commiseration of some sort, surely many of you reading have probably experienced this. \n\nThe cute guy kind of glanced back at me and smiled but I had one of my headphones in listening to music, so I nodded back. I kept noticing him kind of attempting to look my way (or possibly he was just annoyed and waiting, hard to tell). \n\nI kept thinking, \"huh, I'd love to find a way to give this guy my number\". It's hard enough to meet people you think are attractive or interested in dating. I haven't had any real luck with online dating (especially in my current city, which defaults to a hook up culture) and have been thinking about how to meet people in person. \n\nSo I put this to you: how does one takes this kind of situation to the next level? Is it possible to ask someone out with little to no pre-text? Obviously it's risky, you never know someone's situation, but is it just plain weird or gutsy and admirable?\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been together nearly 4 years. I am going to be attending grad school and she is in undergraduate school. We have lived together for a year and we're pretty boring people. We're both introverts and have had maybe two fights through the duration of our relationship. I'm flexible and she's flexible. There has been no cheating or jealousy feuds. Sex maybe once per 1.5 weeks on average. You can said we are 'content' or 'happy.' We're best friends.\n\nAround Christmas time last year a member of her close family died and she's really starting to develop her relationship with God.

She wants a Christian husband with Christian values (all of which are the same of mine; I was raised Catholic\/Protestant). It's important for her partner to be Christian because it has something to do with purity of marriage and how that helps you build a closer relationship to God. She wants to better serve God in any way she can. I respect her views and her motives. I went to church with her last weekend.\n\nAbout two weeks ago when I was kissing her before bed she said that she doesn't want to have sex out of marriage anymore and that doing it makes her feel guilty.

Sex is important to me because I believe that it creates and shows love and also it's fun. I just don't believe you have to get married to do it. \n\nIt might be easy for you to type \"just break up,\" but if you haven't built something for 4 years, it's a little more difficult to understand why this isn't easy especially because we're good friends in good standing.\n\nAnyone have any insight?\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I fix it?\nPOST: Backstory, I am moving out for the first time, spent some time home saving up money and all that good stuff. I've never had a roommate. I have no idea what this all entails, but I assume(d) that the general rules of relationships would apply. My Roommate is a friend(yes, I know...\"she won't be your friend after living together\") However, her anxiety and personal issues have resulted in some issues....\n\n    Having my boyfriend over, for example. We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room. I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month. She also does not want my friends over, ever.\n\n    I originally had plans to move in on Thursday\/Friday, however due to last minute plans, I had to switch to Friday\/Sunday. This resulted in us being there together Sunday. I was met with stomping everywhere she went and silence to any questions I asked....She is now saying that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    What have I gotten myself in to??? How can I navigate this to come to a compromise with someone so unwilling? I'm already stuck with this, since the lease is signed. I just need a way to make the best of it.\n\nTL;DR:",

More info inside...\nPOST: We are both in High School yet, and when my ex boyfriend (Lets call him \"Randy\") and I started dating in mid September this last year, 2011. We were together a little over a month, so through October, but during that time he was extremely pushy about everything, and with everything. He couldnt keep his hands to himself, and was abusive physically and verbally. We would be sitting in the park nearby my house, and he would push me down onto the picnic, pin me there, and run his hands up my shirt and down my pants. I had a curfew to  be home by, and wouldnt care, he'd keep me pinned on the table grinding his nasty body against mine. I would tell him I didnt want this to happen, that I wasnt comfortable, and he told me that if I didnt go along with it that he would spread word around that I was sleeping with all these different guys, that I was smokin' it up everyday, that I cheated on my past boyfriends with someone else, etc. So naturally I was scared to say anything against what he \"wanted to do.\"  Along with pinning me down, he would take my hand and force me to give him a handjob and would try to thrust my head down to give him a blowjob as well. \n\nThis happened on numerous occasions...I feel so guilty right now for not laying down ground rules and boundaries, and Im full of regret that had anything to do with him. \nWhat scares me though is that this all happened in September-October 2011, and I just filed sexual harrassment against him last month or so. The reason I waited so long was because I was afraid to talk about it to anybody, I was constantly angry so I distanced myself from people. Until I finally opened up to one of my closest friends about what he did, and she suggested I file sexual assault.\nSo now I have to write a victim impact statement, and I was wondering if Reddit had any tips for doing that? I believe myself to be good with words, but I just want this to be the best possible so that (hopefully) something will be done.\n\nTL;DR:",

She gave me very few details, as it was over the phone and she was pretty upset, but she did happen to say that there is a high rate of success if treated early with chemo. I've met both of her parents, and they are wonderful and generous people. Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to approach her and provide the right kind of emotional support.

I have no idea whether this is a health-related issue or a psychological thing, but his breathing is loud enough to make it hard to hear the (albeit soft-spoken) professor.\n\nWhat do I do, Reddit? These seem like issues that shouldn't really exist, but can anything be done?\n\nTL;DR:",

Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a \"BANG BANG\" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass. Along with having to go to that class tommrow I know for a fact my teacher is going to question me and im gonna get a call from the therapist. Also could this have any kind of long term affect on me?\n\nTL;DR:",

We all came from different parts of the country to do the same thing, so naturally our shared experience made us all pretty close friends. Well, a few nights ago, we're all out as a group (about 50 of us), getting tanked and listening to live music. The night takes us all our seperate ways and with our seperate smaller groups of friends. I end up with one of my closest friends here and a few others. This girl is VERY attractive, I'd say out of my league. While I've always been attracted to her, it's never been like, something I've pursued because of the fact we work very closely together, and I genuinely just enjoy her company. Well... After a night fueled by fireball, friend and I end up drunkenly (very, very drunkenly) boning. \n\nthe next morning, we wake up, everything seems... Alright. We laugh it off, say everything is cool and that's that. Fast forward to that evening, our large group is out for a birthday party. Instantly I can tell things are awkward. She won't make eye contact with me, and we don't talk. At all. Which is weird. I make the rounds, say goodnight, and go home. \n\nWell, now it's the next morning and I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to salvage this situation. Sorry it's not humorous, or super cringeworthy, but any guidance others might have in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

I've been seeing a guy now for a few months. I met him right as I was getting out of a messy relationship that really fucked with my head. But he's made me so happy since I've started seeing him and I can really see a future with him. But we haven't yet talked about where we see this going. We've both said we aren't sleeping with other people, but we haven't yet said whether or not we want to be in a relationship. I'm having trouble bringing up the subject. Mostly because my last relationship ended so badly and it makes me nervous to let someone else in. I'm also worried that our age difference might be too much for him because every once in a while he'll make a joke about how young I am. \n\nI know that being scared to have this conversation seems stupid and most of you will probably think that I shouldn't be with someone I can't have this conversation with. But I guess I just can't decide if having this talk after only a couple months is rushing into something or if I'm going to sound crazy. I guess I just need a pep talk or something. Any advice is greatly appreciated\n\nTL;DR:",

I said I was falling in love with her and she said she really liked me. At one point in the conversation, she almost said I love you...but stopped.

I said for us to be monogamous but not official to determine if our feelings are real and not circumstantial. \n\nAt these times when I talk about the state of our relationship, I feel like she always agree with what I say and doesn't give any dissent.
