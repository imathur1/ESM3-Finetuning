However on my way into work today I heard something and I want to try to understand what\/how their premise works.

The ad is from a \"financial adviser\" agency but the does talks in my area, but I want to understand why\/how this could work out to be beneficial.  Does it simply have to do with them claiming that they can get a better RoR on investments (stocks, etc) off a down payment that would nullify the interest?

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make me feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and frekaing out and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Everytime I mention that I want\/need a night in it feel like he he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'ma afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete frekout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini breakdowns.

I can't believe I'm in this situation.\n\nI was recently promoted to Store Manager of a grocery store after the original manager quit (I was assisstant manager before for about 6 months).\n\nWe hired a woman, let's call her Sally, a couple of weeks ago. She's not terrible at her job (just basic cashier stuff) but she refuses to process payments that equal $6.66. I know, it sounds crazy.\n\nOur store prices everything ending in 28 cents as a ploy (kinda like Brandsmart). So anything priced at $6.28 will ring up to $6.66 after tax, and it happens quite often that people will buy just that one item (which I've learned after Sally started working here).\n\nEvery time this happens, one of the managers or supervisors has to take over because she refuses and sometimes it throws a spanner in the works. I brought it up with HR and they said I can't do anything about it because it's her religious freedom (since 666 is the number of the beast in Christianity).\n\nThe thing is, we have the same religion; we even go to the same church! But I don't think she should be able to use that excuse to not ring those transactions. I've offered to move her to another part of the store but she doesn't want to stock or do anything else.\n\nHR warned me not to decrease her hours or I'd get in trouble, but I just don't see how I can do my job properly if I have to take care of petty stuff like this.\n\nIs there a law or something that says I'm right? I don't want to go back to HR without knowing I'm 100% right that she shouldn't have the job if she can't perform all aspects of it.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, I suppose I can bear it even if I do think it's ridiculous.\n\nTL;DR:",

Before we got married, he was planning for a while to go into the Marines and then halfway through our engagement changed his mind. He decided he was going to go into law enforcement as a career instead. He tried to get into the police department in Colorado Springs, where we recently moved to, and didn't get in. We started making plans on moving back to Michigan where his family is and he could try there.\n\nWe got talking the other night about our future plans and he told me he wants to join the Air Force and has been thinking about it the past few months. He wants me to think about it and make a decision on if he can do so or not. He said he would wait to join until we moved back so I could be close to my family and friends when he goes to boot camp. \n\nAfter he said no about going into the Marines, I kind of \"washed my hands\" of any idea with the armed forces. I really don't want him to, but he said that he fears if I say no, then years down the line, he may start to resent me.  I want to have kids in about 3 years, which he knows, and I don't want him to miss out on important occasions in our marriage like my pregnancy\/ the first year of our child's life. I also have a big fear of being alone. We have been together for about 5.5-6 years, and any extended period of time we have been apart, I have a rough time being alone, especially if there is nothing to occupy my time.\n\nI've had a few people agree with me, that it is a big decision and sort of an extreme one, and I have had others say that the benefits are great and it would help us to become financially stable. \n\nI just really want some opinions and things to think about! Thanks!\n\nTL;DR:",

We were in secret because my parents are (racist?) in the way that they only want me to date people from an Asian background like me, and she is white. Eventually, because our school is super small and rumors spread like crazy, the staff found out maybe about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even had to use generic words like \"girlfriend and her mom\" instead of saying names to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends, no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this, and it's very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school administration has said things such as, \"She's in a lower social class, he can do better,\" \"She's bringing his grades down\" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my parents have also said things such as \"She's white trash,\" and \"She's a gold digger,\" I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven't even spoken to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I'm not sure what to do. Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies for the next year if I get caught? Do I  make arrangements to get back together in a year? Or Do I just give up and accept it as over? All of this stress is really getting to me, and I  have no idea what the best choice is. Thanks for reading all of that, and giving me any feedback!\n\nTL;DR:",

She is really dear to me but knowing these parts makes me feel unpleasant in her surroundings. Whenever she travells, she comes back with bunch of stuff such as shirts, earrings, bracelets, shorts and all the stuff you could put in your bag. The other day she asked me if I wanted to go with her in chinese shopping mall and steal stuff for summer, I said yes just to avoid further asking because I needed to think about it. I never really stole anything and that is not what my parents taught me. I just dont support it at all, especially if its material stuff that im stealing. If I have to steal one necklace, I don't even need it at all, it would always remind me of the bad ''small krime'' i did. However, today she came back from short trip with her friends in nearby village, with a really nice necklace and I asked her where did she find it since it really looks appealing to me and also, my style. She said, with such a nonchalance, that she stole it in an open-air store. That was the moment where I thought ''Why do you keep doing it''.\n\nShe comes from pretty nice and harmonic family, she is a student and we all live in a students dorm. Her parents send her enough money for food and I guess she could always ask them for more money.\n\nDo you, dear redditors, consider her a cleptomaniac? What are the causes?\n\nTL;DR:",

I am obviously a lot older now and it is still present below my knee (as a nice big lump). It causes me a lot of discomfort and pain. I have a total of a 30 min walk to work in the morning and evening and for the rest of the day I am sitting down mostly. After long periods this can make my knee really ache.\n\nI am quite an active person; I play a lot of Paintball (running and squatting for long periods at a time), squash and swimming. After these activities the pain does flair up and i usually just put up with it!\n\nI have seen the doctors and they said that there isn't much to do other than try to rest it as much as possible and take some ibuprofen when the pain flairs up.

Basically there are two women I'll call one Cara and the other Steph. I arranged to have a dinner with Steph (she is an awesome cook), Cara was the driving force since they haven't seen each other in a while. This was 2 weeks ago. A few other people were invited, Cara asked Steph to make her favorite dish.\n\nDay of the dinner, Cara doesn't show. We were hanging out earlier but needed to do other things so we went our separate ways (3 hrs before the dinner). She didn't answer any calls or texts. Steph was upset but she said it was fine (probably isn't but I'm talking her through it).\n\nI was worried and called and next day (it was close to 24hrs since I last heard from her) and her friend picked up saying they're out bike riding. He puts Cara on the phone and she said she was sick and she currently doesn't have her phone on her. \n\nI've talked with Steph and Cara hasn't called or texted, nothing. I'm a bit upset. I honestly didn't think Cara would act this way, and frankly I'm disappointed. We hang out more often than Steph due to distance, but now I feel like she is just being rude. Cara is feeling a bit of tension from me since I've barely responded to her or talked to her (I help her with business for free when I have free time).\n\nShould I tell Cara my opinions? \n- That I think it was quite rude to stand people up \n- Not contact anyone involved at the dinner for over 22hrs (only being reached by someone contacting her) causing us to worry\n- Being \"sick\" with no phone but still well enough to go out? (I call bull but purely speculation)\n- And finally not even contacting Steph after missing a dinner planned for her\n\nOr am I wrong since it's her life (she and her friend sounded annoyed\/tense? when I called)\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm posting this on mobile so I'm sorry in advance for any formatting errors! \n\nI met my boyfriend, L, 2 years ago. We hit it off instantly and the chemistry between us was insane. I know the age difference seems a little strange, but we've made it work with very little struggle until now.\n\nWe moved in together in August after dating for about 1.5 years. When we first started dating, we were having sex every time we saw each other. That was 5-7 times a week. Naturally as our relationship matured, the sex slowed down a little bit. For the past year and a half, we have sex maybe twice a month, and I have to initiate it every time. Since we've lived together (4 months) he has initiated once. Now I'm not naive, and I know he watches porn and masturbates daily. I've come across the porn on his phone. I've been trying to tell myself that I'm perfectly ok with this and that it doesn't hurt me at all. But I can't lie to myself anymore. I am hurt. He chooses porn over me daily. I've tried to talk to him before about how the fact that he never initiates sex with me hurts my feelings and makes me feel unwanted, and those conversations lead to him giving me a thousand excuses and initiating once the next day and everything goes back to the way it was for a few months. I've never brought up the porn because I'm really scared he will choose it over me... He really is the love of my life and other than this, our relationship is nearly perfect. He is a very caring man and I know he is who I want to spend the rest of my life with. R\/relationships, how do I fix our sex life? I want to have sex more often, and I want him to initiate it more.

He got my number before we went to his place.\n\nObviously, we hooked up and he said a lot of \"sweet\" things (like constantly mentioning that he loved what was happening and that he really liked me a lot - I know that can't be entirely true though as we only had just met). After we were done, he kept mentioning that sex with me was the best and I said that I should probably go home as I didn't want to overstay, but he told me not to worry and to spend the night.\n\nIn the morning, he kept on cuddling up to me while we were both awake and we kind of just lingered in bed for about an hour because we both weren't feeling 100%. I was going to walk home, but he insisted on driving me, so I let him. There was just small talk in the car about plans for the day (what we were each doing) and about how we both didn't even plan on going out the night before.\nBefore I got out of the car, he double checked to make sure he got my number.\n\nMy question I guess is - do you usually hear from guys like this again? I guess because of the cuddling in the morning, and some comments he made during the night and then the checking to make sure he got my number are throwing me off a bit. I know this very well could be a one night stand, but what do you think from a listeners POV? It's only been almost three days since I last saw him.\n\n(\n\nTL;DR:",

After the breakup, he expected that I'd eventually come crawling back. It took a lot of work not to, but I cut the cord and haven't spoken to him in 5 months now, even when he was sending me death threats. Asshole. One of my best girlfriends, let's call her Alice, knows all about this and was there for me through it all. She would do what all good girlfriends do: take me out for lunch, coffee, come over, cry with me, etc. \n\nAbout three months ago, Alice went through a breakup of her own, and I was there for her every day. \n\nYesterday, I thought it OK to finally unblock my ex Bill on Facebook. Morbid curiosity, maybe? Most of his Facebook posts are private, but he has several photos that are public. Recent photos, some photos that were even taken at the same time that Alice and I were together hanging out. Anyway, it turns out that Alice is still friends with Bill on Facebook (not a big deal), and she has been commenting and liking all of this posts (big deal--wtf?).\n\nI'm 100% certain Alice isn't interested in Bill sexually, as she is dating someone new now and completely head over heels. Her new man is all she can talk about. So her actions with my ex on Facebook really don't compute. \n\nI realize that it's a touch childish to worry about things over Facebook, but this definitely rubs me the wrong way. I can't really think of a good way to confront her about it either, because I'm afraid she'll immediately go on the defensive. As it stands now, I'm just going to put her at arm's length. This really, really sucks.\n\nAny advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

We would try to see each other all the time, we would talk on the phone every night for hours, we would text all day.\n\nWhen we first met, there was a lot of chemistry and we were very upfront about what we wanted - both of us wanted relationships as an endgoal.\n\nI was hesitant at first about being so lovey-dovey so quick, but he seemed so genuine when he told me how he felt, so I kind of dove in right behind him.\n\nAfter our first couple of dates, he went on vacation and things were still amazing. We would talk all the time and feelings only grew. He came back and we had another date (and sex) and things fizzled.\n\nAfter that, he flaked on our next planned date, but made sure to plan another one in its place. We did go out, had sex again, but things didn't change. It still felt different. I told him if he had lost interest, it was fine - it happens. But he still said he wanted to talk to and see me, but it was just work and distance (he lives an hour away) that was making it hard.\n\nWe tried make plans one more time for him to come down. He said \"he will let me know,\" and didn't end up texting me all that day. I broke things off because I've played this game before - someone who wants to be with me, would be. This guy did not. So I pretty much ended things, saying it was just disappointing but for the best, and he agreed.\n\nDays later, he texted me and apologized. Said the more he saw me, it didn't feel \"natural for us to be together\" and work just made it harder. Also told me it wasn't anyone else in the picture either. We kind of got into a back and forth and he admit, he just lost interest. He pretty much said he strung me along because \"he just wanted to like me back\" which is confusing to me, because in the beginning all he could talk about was how much he liked me.\n\nTL;DR:",

Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.\n\nSo, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.\n\nBut, I'm drawing a blank.

It kinda explains why she's been distant lately, but what should I do?\nPOST: Ok, so a bit of background. It was the last day of our vacation and the three of us were sat in his (the boyfs) room. We ended up playing strip poker. Half way through she left but said she'd be back in a minute, so I stayed a bit longer. When she came back, she said she was going to bed, but being the last day of our vacation, I didn't want to leave then, and I still had my clothes on, so I just said we'd finish playing. \n\nI really regret not leaving with her, but I thought everything would be fine as I was still fully clothed. It was an error of judgement. \n\nHe starts getting touchy-feeley and makes me take my top of, which, regretfully, I did. Then he starts trying to get me to have sex with him. I refuse. He starts trying to get me to give him a handjob. I sort of pat it. He trys to put it between my tits but I'm moving away. \n\nAt this point the door busts open and it's my friend. He springs away like a bolt of lightening, which I thought then made the situation look worse. She said she'd forgotten her purse and leaves straight away. Only last week my friend tells me she'd returned to our room crying and saying she'd caught me giving him head. \n\nNow I don't know what to do. It was a while ago, so I don't just want to randomly bring it up out of no-where, but we were pretty good friends, and the last thing I want is to ruin it because of all this.

We have two young children of 1 and 5. About two years ago i found out that my wife was having an 'emotional affair' with someone who she worked with. This lasted about six months and he even left his wife, at least partially for her. She denies that anything physical happened, but they went on coffee dates etc.. and there were clearly inappropriate moments and probably text messages. She refuses to go into detail saying she doesnt want to hurt me. \n\nI cant change what happened and actually dont think I really want to know the extent. She said she is sorry for what happened but doesnt take full responsibility and partially blames what happened on my long work hours and work stress which she says affected our relationship. We had a very rough patch but she eventually ended contact and they no longer work together. We had our second child after that, but things have never been the same. \n\nWe hardly ever have sex (about once every 4 to 5 months) because she says that she doesnt have any libido and has also suffers with very bad dyspareunia. She is pretty affectionate but she resists any physical advances from my side and says that she needs more time. She has been seeing a gynecologict for over a year but things are not better. \n\nI am at my wits end. We used to have great sex, about twice a week at least. I cant help but think that there is more going on. We have tried therapy but things are not better. I have considered hiring a PI to follow her and find out if something else is up.

Where one person has more benefit than the other? Well I've only had one of these and it so happens to be with my \"best friend\". I've always been there for her, when she got pregnant and aborted, when she got pregnant again and delivered her baby, every time she has had issues with her baby daddy, you get the point. She's been there for me too but for some reason every time we hang out we always talk about her and her problems. She asks general questions about what goes on in my life but nothing too deep. I love her because we've been friends since we were 13 years old. But I'm tired of being a GREAT friend to her when she is barely a friend to me. We've both talked about this (because I brought it up) and even cried about it. We decided we'd try to be more involved in each other's lives but nothing has changed. I'm pretty tired of it because I feel used and I really don't benefit much from this friendship. \n\nSo now getting to my question. Her family loves me. I've never been a bad influence on her, I've been a great friend to her and they see that I love her and her baby.  That's what her sister told me when she asked me to be her bridesmaid last year. Her sister and I get along well and knowing that her list of friends is short I felt bad and told her yes.  Now that we are getting ready to buy bridesmaid dresses and my relationship with my \"best friend\" hasn't gotten better I'm kind of thinking of backing out of this. I know her sister is not at fault here but I don't know if I'd feel comfortable being a bridesmaid anymore. Should I talk to the sister\/bride? Should I have another talk with my \"best friend\"? Any advice\/help is appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

I get to do what I love, in a killer place, but I don't really make a lot of money considering the field I'm in.  I work in a non-profit museum institution doing video production, and AV technical support as a secondary element to the job.  My salary is barely ok for an entry level position in my field (~30K), even though the work I've been doing up until this point is quite beyond entry level imo, but that's neither here nor there.  \n\nMy predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.  While I agree I do want to keep making creative videos, I'm weary that they're going to try and dump his work load (relatively little in comparison) on top of mine with a minimal raise.  There is very much a rank non-profit culture here, very top heavy, and upward mobility is notoriously difficult (just as a caveat to anyone who might understand the particulars).  \n\nAnd so my question is, how do I figure out in a cordial and non-confrontational way how much is fair for them to offer me for the promotion with additional responsibilities?  I realize I could just ask my current boss how much he's making but that doesn't seem proper or legit, plus he's been here for 20 years so they can always pull the seniority card.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been officially dating for a month, seeing way other for a couple weeks before that. When we first started chatting on tinder she mentioned (on her profile) how she was looking for friends only. After meeting her I knew I wanted to be more than friends, one thing led to another and we started dating.\n\nEverything has been going awesome! But I just have one \"issue\".\n\nBefore I met my gf she met another guy off tinder. She's told me about him and when we first committed to dating each other she told me how he would only ever be a friend and nothing more. She said I don't need to worry about him and that she's all mine. Ok great. I'm not against having friends of the opposite sex, I have some friends who are female myself. \n\nMy problem is that when they do hangout (maybe once or twice every couple weeks) they seem to almost go on \"dates\".  They don't hangout in group settings (always just the two of them). Last time they hung out, my gf went over to his place to watch movies. Tonight they are going to a board game bar.\n\nMy girlfriend is honestly the nicest person I've ever met. She's never given me a reason to mistrust her but I can't help but feel uncomfortable with their friendship. I've never met this guy and she doesn't have him on FB so I have no idea what he looks like. Should I be concerned with this? I trust her but being a dude I know how guys think. \n\nAny advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

There's just not much going on!  When I finished high school, I went and worked at a bed and breakfast in PEI.  That was nice, but still really quiet.  When the season ended, I went to Scotland and then went around the UK for 2 months.  It was awesome!  I loved the whole experience, but I especially liked London.  The hustle and bustle of the city, the sheer numbers of people, the transport, the pubs, everything.  There always something to see or do!  I ended up going back to Europe a few months later (for 2.5 months).  Thing is...I still haven't got it out of my system!  I'd love to go over there and work for the summer (or longer) but I'm not sure how to go about it.\n\nThis site seems almost too good to be true, it's exactly what I want.  The application fee is a bit steep though.  Does anyone have experience with this company or something similar?  Is there better ways to get my foot in the door?  Is there scams and such that I should look out for?\n\nI'm very lucky in the fact that I have a have full time job that will still be available should I choose to go abroad for a few months.

I should mention that this is the strongest I've ever felt about a girl I've been in a relationship with and that this is probably the most advanced relationship I've ever been in (i.e. It doesn't just feel like one of your typical high school relationships to me, I truly care about her) It's clear that we both really like each other but I constantly worry for a bunch of reasons. \n\nAbout a week or so ago she brought up the conversation of what our label was (which I was too scared to bring up because I was worried her definition for what we were would be much less than what mine was). We both ultimately came up with the conclusion that we are dating. Fast forward a few weeks, I find out from my friends that she  constantly and firmly tells them that her and I are not dating. This made me upset because then I think that she feels differently about me than she says she does. \n\nThe back story to her past relationships is that almost a year ago her boyfriend of two years broke up with her because he was going to college. I know she was in love with him and it pains me that no matter what I could never live up to what he was to her. Do you think this may have something to do with her saying we aren't dating behind my back? Maybe dating isn't even the right word, perhaps we are at the point where we are in a relationship. The other thing is that she pretty much freaks out if anyone if thinks that I'm her boyfriend or she's my girlfriend. She insists that she really likes me and really cares about me, but sometimes I just worry. What do you think of all this?\n\nTL;DR:",

This doesn't mean Americans only, we live in a global society and our governments decisions and actions affect everyone. \nSecond: This should not be an indictment of the wrongs committed by the government. Everyone has their own opinions on what injustice has been done to the people or to industry. The ceaseless bickering has stagnated us, we argue and drain our energy and then retire to the conveniences we are so blessed to have, believing that to act would be as fruitless as the senseless arguments we get caught up in.\n \n\nFor the sake of accomplishing something let's start this discussion with how to get started. How do we organize effectively? How can we communicate efficiently? What can be done to overcome the mass polarization of the nation? All I know for certain is that we are divided. Is this the worst divide in our nations history? I don't know, but I doubt it. We aren't killing each other yet, that's something at least.

For all that time we liked each other but never did anything about it 'cause it'll feel weird. Last friday, my friend (his ex) was hosting a party and she invited us. She kept saying all night how cute he thinks I am, how he always talked fondly about me and what not. At the end of the night, she made us kiss and so we did. After that our whole relationship changed and my enormous crush on him was out in the open having a blast. We kissed 'til the morning light. He's sweet, sensitive, smart, funny and I spend the best time with him.\n\nThe thing is that I broke up a 2 year relationship with a guy 5 months ago because of the distance and loss of interest. When I say lost of interest I mean I lost all interest because he was 28 with no job and no degree and no nothing, I wanted to get married, have a family and lots of things but he didn't moved his ass out of the computer; I even helped him get up his chair and he fought me for it. Now I'm scared the same thing will happen with this guy 'cause he has a crappy-3-days-a-week job and also no degree. \n\nI've never been so crazy about anyone in my life, not even the guy I spent 2 years of my life with.

Had a brief chat today with her about brain farts and the really chilly weather outside. Ordered my coffee and another one for a family member. When I headed over to the pickup side of the counter she asked if the iced coffee was for me (it was). When I said yes she immediately got a size larger and remarked that she was giving it to me for free. Then she stopped me before I walked out and gave me a free coupon for next time. \n\nShe's always been super friendly when I order but never to this extent. How do I non-creepily go about testing the waters. I've always had this mental \"block\" towards hitting on cashiers. It just doesn't seem like good practice and could easily come across as being on the weird\/stalker side of things. \n\nI realize that she may in fact have just been trying to keep up customer loyalty but there was definitely a flirty hint in the manner that she did all of this. \n\nHave you folks had situations like this?

About a month ago, she decided she was ready to get a new dog, so we adopted a beagle\/pug mix puppy. Between getting up at 5a.m. to go to school, studying\/doing homework, working out, and having a social life, I didn't have much time to help take care of it. My mother and second eldest sister are both disabled, so they can't work, and were suppose to take care of the dog that *they* wanted. Between them two, and my eldest sister, who is a home-health-aid for my mom and lives with us, she apparently was too much to handle, and I was harrased by them to help more, even though I didn't have too much time. They also didn't consider the fact that I'm alergic to dogs, and could hardly touch her. Anyway, the dog was always biting my hands, but no one cared... until she bit my eldest sister. They just returned her because of this, and my mom is upset... because, even how much she complained about it, she loved the dog. My eldest sister's cat absolutely loves my mom, and is always cuddling with her and not my sister, which also causes problems, but that is apparently not good enough. She is now mad at *me* for not helping out, even though I'm alergic to dogs and break out whenever one scratches\/bites me, something the dog was notorious\/returned for. I know I went on a tangent there, but I'm trying to ask, what are some things that will keep my mom busy?\n\nTL;DR:",

That being said, we've been together for two years now and he still will not call me his girlfriend or publicly announce our relationship at all. He knows this hurts me, he does feel bad about it, but he just doesn't want us to be public right now. The thing is, he seems to see this as something completely normal. He genuinely doesn't seem to get why I want us to be public and sees it more as a way for me to just brag about our relationship. I love him. He's the first person I've ever loved and has been a very good friend for a long time. I feel like even if we would break up, the only way I could even get over him at all would be to cut ties with him completely. I don't want to do that and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I don't understand what he's so afraid of. He's heavily introverted, which I do have a basic understanding of, and he comes from a family that doesn't really discuss each other's personal lives, so for the two years that I've been coming over and seeing him, his parents have never really acknowledged me much (he's still in college and living at home). I'm at my wits end. I don't know what to say anymore and I don't know what to do anymore. He isn't intentially hurting me, he just has a lot of anxiety that's running his life verses being dealt with. Does anyone have any advice other than just breaking up with him?

In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.\n\nFor a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to \"evaluate her feelings\", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of \"us\", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.\n\nAfter a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical\/mental affection (often not both at the same time).\n\nIs this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?\nShould i be open about my feelings and experiences (we made a clause on breakup, she didnt want to know anything i did with other people while we were separated, and told me to lie if i had done anything) or would that just end everything, and if it did is that for the best?\n\nIf someone could just live my life for me for a bit and give it back in a few months that would be grand :D\n\nTL;DR:",

We didn't know each other, only had like 5min. conversation before.\nNow, yesterday was our 3rd date. She initiated it, but at the scene suddenly seemed distant. She even said a few things that baffled me:\n\n1) She mentioned going abroad in two years to finish her degree.\n(it's like she wanted me to lose interest in her)\n\n2) She told me that her mother tried to match her with some of her colleagues over the last few years, but she found them boring or selfish. It's like she wanted to show me that she was not in a commited relationship for a long time.\n\n3) Later we got some ice cream and she offered to pay for everything. I said OK, because I would have to change my money first. So she paid, and I told her I'll change it on the way back.\nBut there was no such possibility so I said (while getting out of a tram): \"I'll return it another time\" and she responded:\n\"If there is going to be another time\". I was so baffled by this that I didn't respond. I just kissed her and had to leave.\n\nNow, as you can see, she's less interested in me than I am in her. I suppose I have three options now:\n\na) try to schedule a next date and make it really special\n\nb) give her some space and time to rethink (?)\n\nc) she's not undecided - I already lost her and should let her go and move on already\n\nWhat would you do and how would you respond in that situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

As a child, I was sexually, physically and mentally tortured by my mom. As a result, I was diagnosed with severe depression, OCD, PTSD and pretty much the works, which I've been dealing with my whole life. Also have lupus.\n\nI live with my dad who is extremely supportive, and is frankly keeping me alive. I see a therapist, and take 5 different medications. I honestly feel like I haven't made much progress. I don't have a job (therapist says it's not a good idea for me to be working at the moment) and don't have a car (too afraid to drive, and I don't think that'll change ever). I weigh 250 pounds (was 300 at one point), so I'm obese as well. I do get SSI, so I'm covered on health insurance \/ and some allowance.\n\nI've been playing catch up my entire life, and lately, I've been wanting a relationship with someone. I do have friends (online only), but I also want to date. As far as experience, I haven't held a girl's hand or even had a kiss. I've tried okcupid, and even had a date which I thought went well, until she messaged me later saying I was too fat to find anyone.\n\nWith my situation, how do I get out there and meet people? I know this is a therapist question, but she's been at a loss at what I should do as well. \n\nMy dad insists I'm charming, and have a great personality, but I seriously doubt he'd tell me otherwise.\n\nTL;DR:",

I still love her. Deeply. Sharing my life with her is fun, and has always been beautiful. We reached adulthood together and after graduating school we decided to move in together to study in two close cities.\nBut with the start of university I met new people and one girl in particular sparked my interest. \n\nToday, after 8 months of studying and living together with my gf, I am best friends with this particular girl. We laugh a lot and spend a lot of time together, even outside of university. I often thought about, if I am starting to feel more for her than just friendship but quickly buried these thoughts whenever they came up...\nBut I want to, or atleast try to be completly honest with myself and I definetly feel attracted toward her. Both sexually as well as emotionally.\n\nThen, a few days ago we were at her place studying together like we often do, for the upcoming tests. We chatted for a bit and she admitted that she fell in love with me and had a crush on me since the beginning of the degree course. Vice versa I admitted that I DO have feelings for her but that I do not love her and instead love the relationship I currently have and want to keep.\nShe was devastated (never had a boyfriend, hoped for more etc...) and I soothed her. We came each other closer than before and suddenly kissed for a brief moment...\n\nI do not know what to do or think since then... :(\nI feel like I am in love with two persons at the same time and I can not and simply do not want to decide myself for either side.\nI feel so lost and alone in my own thoughts. I do not know what the right decision is. \nAlso, I feel bad and unfaithful. I never wanted to cheat (even if it was just a kiss) on my girlfriend.

After a one year break , I decided that I had to do something in my life , and I ended up in a private CS (Computer Science ) college. \n\u00a0\n\nMy boyfriend , followed the same process as me , but he got in a national Technical School ( maybe that's the wrong term  ,but here we have : universities > technical schools , as we call them , or as I roughly translate at least :P ). He is now on his 10th year and he has to pass 1 lesson to get his degree. He is interested in computers , which has nothing to do with what he used to study.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n**The problem** : Well the obvious problem is that he thinks I'm getting a degree no matter what , because my father's paying a bunch of money. The other problem is that he thinks I'm stupid he explains the most basic stuff like he would explain it to a 4 year old.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFor example: \"You cannot do [insert paragraph here] with this command, the database doesn't allow it\" . And I'm like \"yeah , I know, that's pretty basic stuff\".\n\nI'm seriously thinking of not inviting him to my graduation ceremony,  because what's really the point?  How should I handle this situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

During the day I hardly speak to her, and I like it that way.\n\nTo summarise, I'm not sure if it's her, or me, or the constant talking online, as I hardly spoke to people online before we got together.

My boyfriend [25]had a rough upbringing and a very rough first and only relationship that ended in a divorce. \nHe's not my first relationship. I'm[21] actually a little younger and have been in about 4 (depending what you count as a relationship). His ex was super controlling so I really do my best not to be even when I feel he's out of line.\nHe feels the need to have these like little Internet friends flow over into our relationship. Like one of his online friends didn't like me and basically stopped talking to him over me. All of these \"friends\" are female of course. \nHe posts on several reddits that I don't particularly care for because of their content and doesn't understand why it bothers me. He is just complimenting these women and loves doing it. He's not trying to fuck them or anything that I know of but it makes me really insecure. I've never had a need for the attention of multiple people but he does. He basically craves it, whereas I find it childish. \nHe brags about being hit on and some of his past sexual encounters. I'm about 4-5 years younger than him but I am not less experienced and he always seems to throw the age card out when he disagrees with me. \nI'm very grown for my age. I go to college, work full time and still have a family\/ social life. I've worked for all I have actually. So when he drops that card it is extremely insulting to me. Is it wrong to tell him to stop or leave? I don't want to be belittled because I'm young. Because honestly, he's definitely the younger of us two mentally\n\nTL;DR:",

We're both in the US going to college on opposite sides of the country. We were high school sweethearts and have made it through almost 2 full years of college. We have a very loving relationship and I'm very happy to be in a relationship with her. \n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Sue) is in a sorority and is very active in it. She recently went to a dance they call Formal, and had a blast. It's custom to take a date to these things, and since I wasn't there she took someone whose friends were going but otherwise wasn't technically allowed into the dance. I didn't have a problem with it because I figured they would just hang out with their separate friend groups once in the dance. \n\nSue told me that's exactly what happened and how she even got stood up by the guy - he kind of just showed up with his friends at the dance instead of meeting up beforehand. I was glad she had a good time despite that.\n\nI just checked Facebook and Sue has a new profile picture. It's her and the guy from last night. She is laughing and having a good time, with her hands on his back, and he's doing a somewhat funny face. It's a cute picture, but for some reason her having another guy in her Facebook profile picture makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI scrolled through some of her other pictures and this guy turns up on more than one occasion, even before the dance. I want to ask her if it's the same guy, but she is currently in a dance *performance* (not the same as the Formal she went to last night) so she is unreachable. \n\nNormally I'm not very jealous at all, but seeing that picture just made me sad and feel like I was being replaced for some reason. \n\nMy question is, is there any reason for me to be jealous? If not, please talk some sense into me! We've also been getting in a bunch of small arguments lately so I'd rather handle this in the easiest, most un-confrontational manner. I don't want to fight over this if it's nothing.\n\nTL;DR:",

I found a seat in the back.  Soon after the train left the station a commotion began near the middle of the train car.  A little old man in a suit was standing and yelling (in what I think was Farsi) at a middle aged guy who looked like a pimp who was sitting down.  He was wearing a lot of gold &  sunglasses & a flashy shirt.  Imagine the old man from 'Up' yelling at Samuel L. Jackson.  The pitch of the conflict was starting to rise and I sprung into action.  I immediately stood and walked directly to where the confrontation was taking place (I'm a big guy).  As I walked through the train car, I noticed a kid had begun filming the men on his phone.  When I got there, I stood across the train car from the two men and just stared past them and did nothing.  They both saw me approach and expected me to do something. I did nothing, but my presence was known.  The old man was seething and muttering under his breath.  The pimp looking guy was smiling.   After a moment, I looked the old man in the eye, and then the pimp guy.  The argument stopped and we all stayed there in silence as people came on and off the train, until the last stop.  It was kind of awkward and I wished one of them would move.  At the last stop I moved across the train to make sure they got off before I did.  In my head I was a train Marshall.  The old man said one more thing to the guy as he exited and then they walked to opposite sides of the station.  Fight averted.  This is in TIFU because that would have been a great video and I stopped it from happening.\n\nTL;DR:",

I've been in a long distance relationship with him and we've been going strong for 5 months. He visits me in LA and I visit him in Seattle. I recently visited him in Seattle last weekend for almost a week and not going to lie, the moment i saw him, things seemed \"different\" I kept asking him what's wrong and he said nothing is wrong and that's just how he is. That he is comfortable with me. \na little back story: this guy has liked me since 4 years ago and tried to get with me this whole time and I finally caved in and I really like him now. Even though we're far away from each other, I still wanted to make it work.\n\nAnyways, We had our good times while I was there and I enjoyed every minute of it. Our plan was to move in together within the next couple of months. We even talked about it one more time on my last day in Seattle. He said that he isn't ready and that we should wait a bit more. I was crushed because I was set on moving and everything seemed perfect. When I landed in LA, we talked on the phone and he told me that there's something missing in our relationship and that we seemed \"different\" when I was in Seattle. Like we are not clicking. I knew something was different, but I just thought it was him. But apparently, there was something different between us. I'm so confused. Does he still like me? I don't understand. He's been chasing me for so long and now that he has me, he's not really trying? I still want to be with him, but I dont know if Im willing to wait for him to be \"ready\" He told me to give him some time to think about it, but at this point..if he's already having doubts...isnt it over? Please help, I'm really torn about this. I cant eat or sleep. Should I just move on?\n\nTL;DR:",

However after that he told me something that worried me; apparently when we first met he hated me as he felt i was stealing his best friend (who is now my best friend) and he has had those types of feelings for all his previous best friends. It worries me because he appears to be very possessive towards his best friends and he wants to keep them all to himself.\n \nhe has also done a number of creepy things like asking a female friend of ours to let him sleep in her bed with her and cuddle. He has also joked about raping me a lot over the few years we were best friends and i always thought he playing up to the fact that everyone at our school called us gay or maybe he liked making uncomfortable jokes like that. \n\nThroughout most of our friendship he has wanted to sleep with me and this is a dude that i have shared bedrooms with and now i'm scared that he may have done something creepy while i was asleep. I can't trust him anymore. \n\nThis entire altercation has also split our very close group of friends apart and i need some unbiased opinions on what actions to take as i'm now having to try and convince my friends that i'm not homophobic or a liar. The worse part is that out of the five people in our friendship circle only one person doesn't know about it.\n\nTL;DR:",

I met a girl at a party about a month ago. We've been hanging out almost every weekend since. Last weekend we had sex (lost my virginity.) Probably too early, but whatever. We were talking, and I told her that I wanted a serious relationship not just a FWB kind of deal. She told me that she wasnt ready for a serious relationship, and she doesnt know what she wanted. \n\nThe thing is we have hung out after this, and every time we hang out i like her more and more. Last night, i even dreamt of her... Im trying to hold back my feelings and be cool about it, but its not working. When I daydream its mostly about her. I guess, im asking for advice regarding not getting attached because i know if this continues im just going to get hurt in the end.\n\nTL;DR:",

So, I have been an athlete my whole life, started competitive soccer and other sports when I was 5 (27 now), and have always considered myself physically fit. About 4 years ago, I moved to Hawaii and basically became a beach potato with almost no consistent physical activity for the first time in my life. A year and a half ago, I had a baby with my fiance, moved back to the Mainland, and decided I needed to get my life on track for the benefit of my child (now children). So I quit smoking tobacco and signed up for a half marathon. I was doing my best to follow a training program I found on Garmin Connect, but about 8 weeks into the training I started pushing too hard, running too many miles too fast, a classic rookie maneuver, I know, but it felt so good to build strength in my body and I began to rely on the peaceful solace I found running alone, away from the chaos of raising now 2 small children. Anyway, after a nice long run, a hot shower and a nap, I squatted slightly to pick up my son, and I felt a *pop* in my 2nd toe on my left foot. It swelled immediately, and was painful to walk on, let alone run, for (the past) 6-7 weeks, and although MUCH improved this past 2 weeks, I still feel it occasionally. I did some research and I think it may be either Metatarsalgia or Capsulitis, the symptoms match both somewhat. So my questions are these: would it be stupid to try and run again before the symptoms completely dissipate? and when I do start running again, what mileage is safe? Should I start with a c25k (really don't want to be re-injured)? I was running 5-6 miles 4 days a week, with a long run about 8 miles, again, from not running in years in about an 8-10 week span.\nThanks for the help, and all the inspiration and motivation! (longtime lurker here)\n\nTL;DR:",

I'd like to reach out to get in touch to at least have some friends in a new city, but I admit I wouldn't mind taking it further if the chemistry works out. In fact, I'm more interested to see if after several years this chemistry might be there, but if it isn't then at least I have a friend :)\n\nNow my problem is that I haven't spoken to her in the 8 years since high school (in all honesty I haven't kept up much with my high school friends). And back then we weren't particularly close friends, but we hung out with the same group of people. We weren't close not due to a lack of connection, but rather because I was close friends with different people than she was.\n\nWhat would be the best way to get in touch? I was thinking of just sending a message once I move to meet up for a drink to catch up as I'd like to make some friends in the new place, but I'm concerned that might be a bit questionable as I have plenty of friends in the city already so why would I be contacting her. Admittedly she can't know this, but because the city is so big and central it is highly unlikely I wouldn't have closer friends there already. Any help would be appreciated.

Last year, through some mutual friends I met a girl and everything was absolutely fantastic. The entire time we were dating I was on top of the world, she was caring, sweet and I could tell her anything.\n\nAround Valentine's Day however, she started becoming distant, telling me everything was fine but she'd ignore me and would barely look at\/touch me when we were together.\n\nEventually one night I asked her to tell me what was wrong and she went on to list me a bunch of things she hated about me that weren't necessarily true. She called me jealous, claimed I didn't mean the nice things I'd said to her, just to name a few.\n\nIt destroyed me, but I kept strong because she told me she was struggling with depression and I wanted to make her better. I loved this girl more than anything.\n\nA couple days later, she broke up with me. She said I hadn't done anything wrong, that she still wanted me in her life and that it wasn't necessarily final.\n\nIn the following months, she deleted me off everything, ignored the two attempts I made at texting her and ran from me when I tried to talk to her in public. She later referred to me as He Who Shall Not Be Named when explaining to her friends all the other guys she'd been sleeping with.\n\nI think she may have cheated on me with another guy before ending it, or at least she ended it to be with him.\n\nI miss her still and I was driven to a long depression that I still haven't fully recovered from.

Eventually the girl found her way into our group of friends and became close with all of us for about a year before she started dating the guy. 2 years later they're still dating and the group fell apart for the most part except for us 3.\n\nThey really are great people and never make me feel like a third wheel (probably because I was friends with both prior to dating) and over the last 5 months we got real close I feel. They both helped with with a huge medical scare (I suffer from Crohns) with the female friend always being there to talk and even go with me to the hospital. I have also helped them both out and I know they have told me things that I doubt anyone else knows. We are all very open.\n\nThe problem is they will be moving back away for school 40 mins away. And this upsets me greatly. Since April we have all hung out probably 2-3 times a week every week and even went on vacation together with a few other friends. I feel like the shift now to seeing eachother maybe once a month is going to kill our relationship. I'm worried maybe I'll be replaced by their new roommates or something. That we will slowly drift apart.\n\nI've expressed this concern of wanting to stay in touch and how i'm worried it wont be like that.

However until then, it's basically a long distance relationship, which is something that I think would be difficult to maintain this for such a long time\n\nThe second choice seems more desirable, as it satisfies all parties, however this is still a big commitment, and opens up the possibility to further messes down the road.

We live in the eastern United States, I'm attending grad school, he's attending law school.  We've been dating for 3 months now and have been exclusive for the past month and a half or so.  At this point we don't call each other boyfriend or girlfriend, but he does stay over every couple weeks and I've stayed over his place on multiple occasions.  He's very affectionate in person and in his text messages, he opens car doors for me, we hold hands in public, kiss etc.  I have only met one of his friends, but he's shown my picture to a couple of his gfs.\n\nAnyways to get to the question.  He was asking me what I was doing and I told him I was listening to my friend tell me how she was FB stalking our high school classmates who had hot boyfriends.  And he said \"so she's stalking you? haha jk\" I said \"to answer you, yes :)\" and then \"does that mean you're claiming the boyfriend title haha?\"\n\nHe completely ignored that boyfriend text and moved on with the conversation.  I haven't brought it up again, and don't plan to anytime soon.  I'm assuming this means he's not ready to claim the boyfriend title.  But how do I bring it up again without making him feel like I'm some pushy, clingy girl? By the six month mark I'd like to be considered his GF because otherwise I'd feel like the relationship isn't moving forward.  For me the boyfriend\/girlfriend title wouldn't change our relationship, it would just reinforce my confidence in our relationship.  I'm not going to worry about it for now, but would just like some advice as to how to broach the subject again if necessary and\/or why he's not ready to claim the boyfriend title (myriad of possibilities I know).\n\nTL;DR:",

I know that people think harder about splitting up if they're married rather than dating if someone is found having cheated, but what about situations like the following?  My mentor was describing a situation to me where her husband had lied to her about selling one of their vans in order to get an SUV for their growing family.  It was one of those scooby-doo kind of vans that had fuzzy carpet inside.  She forgave him, even though she was really pissed off about 1) him not selling the van and 2) lying about it.  This is context of the van being disputed between them for several years, and it was obvious that their family needed a more family friendly car.  Now with that said... she said that if this had happened while they were dating, and that she had seen these kind of qualities from him before their wedding, she would have broken up with him right away.  Of course since they ARE married, they worked on it and patched things up.\n\nTL;DR:",

She said it's nothing I've done & that she's \"afraid of hurting me\" & she's had \"an uneasy feeling about the relationship recently\". \n\nOur relationship had been amazing up until this point. Everyone in her life has told her how amazing we are for each other & she's always agreed. Friends she hasn't seen in years can immediately tell that she's happier than she's ever been because of me. This came out of nowhere & completely blindsided me.\n\nWe didn't officially \"break up\" 3 weeks ago, but we haven't been in contact since, until yesterday. I'll be meeting with her tomorrow to talk. If she still insists it's nothing I've done...what should I say?\n\nI honestly think it's due to the hormonal changes the pills are causing. If something comes up tomorrow like another guy or something, I don't bring it up. But if it's nothing like that, how do I approach the subject gracefully?

We met last June and hit it off immediately. We took things very slow for a few months but by November I decided that I wanted to make it official. \n\nEverything was great and we hung out nearly any chance we could. She's helped me quit smoking and always is there to motivate me. We would have occasional little arguments over minuscule things but never like last night.\n\nAs of lately I've began to create bigger issues out of the small things. I know that I can be jealous and rude sometimes but she isn't going to put up with that forever. I want to be better and I know I can be. I've been really emotional about the thought of losing her especially when I know it's something that is all my fault. I can't change the past but I really want her to see that I am still the guy she met in June. \n\nI just need some input from others. I didn't know where to turn and I've never done this before but I hope someone out there can help me.\n\nTL;DR:",

Libby (15\/f). \n\nBackground information: I met Amanda in a class, and we liked each other. I asked her to a school formal, and she agreed. We've been going to group things like BBQ's and bowling for about a year. We're not *dating*, but I planned on it once we get older (my personal opinion is that most dating relationships started young end badly). Anyways, about halfway through my seeing Amanda, Libby came into my life. We started out as friends, nothing more, but gradually grew into best friends. Like, super close friends. Anyways, we've talked and just grown closer. Now, back to the present. I'm still seeing Amanda, but I really like Libby, and she really likes me. Now, don't get me wrong, Amanda's a great girl, and I would love to keep our relationship going, but Libby.... I just really like Libby, and I think we would just be better in the long run. But I don't want to hurt Amanda by breaking up with her! Sometimes, I wish something happened in me and Amanda's relationship where she just didn't like me anymore, or something, just so I can be with Libby. But... I just don't know what to do, at all. I'm so confused. I need help. Please help! \n\nNote, we are in a small, private school. If anything happened, everyone would know about it.\n\nTL;DR:",

I told her it was a bad idea and she should just stay and get a place with me like we talked about before. She then told me I was a bad friend for trying to keep her from pursuing her BF. We stopped talking, she dropped all contact with me and that was it. \n\nTime went on; I went through my old high school things at my parent's place and got a bit emotional looking at old photos of the two of us with our other friends. \n\nOne thing led to another and I tracked her down on facebook.

I'm also insecure about my level of femininity.  \nMen that I meet (work\/socially) are hardly ever single.  The ones who are and that I get to know, I almost always develop a crush, but try so hard to hide it that they just end up becoming a good friend of mine.  They usually make it clear that they are attracted to me, but I disregard it.  I make it so easy to be comfortable with, the start sharing secrets and life stories and I do the same.  And that's where I know I screw up.  I also think I am headstrong, brazen and outspoken.  I'm very opinionated.  Also, I'm not as feminine (clothing) as other women.  I wear makeup, do cute hairstyles, wear lipstick, do my nails, wear jewelry, I have a perfume collection, etc.  But I do not wear skirts, dresses, or heels and open-toed shoes.  I think it is all beautiful, but I feel so alien like with it on.   I'm not a tomboy, I just don't like super girly attire.  I've had a male friend tell me that he and a lot of other men would date me if I was more feminine and submissive.  \nAlso, I've dated a couple of guys in the past who refuse to get serious with me.  They don't take me seriously romantically.  It seems like they'll try to hook up (9\/10 times I'm not putting out) but not make anything exclusive.  I'm starting to feel real insecure.  Am I crazy and just don't know it?  Do men really only date super feminine women?  Am I too friendly?  How can I become more comfortable?  What do men like?  I'm at a age where I want to be in a relationship and fall in love, but I'm not sure if someone will ever accept me for me.  Sorry for the pity party.  I've been single for so long, I have to accept it is my fault.\n\nTL;DR:",

This is why there shouldn't be two people angry at the same time. I want to apologize first, but how do I apologize and lessen her anger without sounding like a pushover?\n\nTL;DR:",

He recently moved back to our hometown, which gave us the opportunity to hang out this weekend over the holiday. Before I saw him in person we had started texting a bit. It was pretty harmless, but it is clear that he still as feelings for me. When we hung out this weekend it was a bit awkward. I'm not sure if that's because he's not as into me as he thought (I suspect he held onto strong feelings form HS that may or may not hold now) or maybe it was uncomfortable because he does still have feelings for me. Maybe it's something else...?\n\nSo now I'm unsure about how about to handle this. I'd like to continue talking to him, but I also don't want to give him false hope. If it's possible, how do I nurture a friendship without leading him on? Do I let him be the first to call or text? If he cares about me it seems shitty to never initiate contact, but then again this may make him feel false hope... Is this even possible?\n\nI should also note a couple things. There is another female in his life, but she is in another state and they're not in a committed relationship. Also, my partner of 7 years [m, 24] knows that we've been talking and that I hung out with him over break. He is totally find with me talking and hanging out with him.\n\nTL;DR:",

My shifts are timetabled around availability and lectures so sometimes I won't see some of the people on my team for weeks at a time. Worked my first shift with one of my coworkers a couple months ago and my first reaction was that he is totally my type but I should just get over it because I should be professional. Work a couple more shifts with him and we talk during the breaks about our interests, and he'd always greet me with a smile and ask me about my day. He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.\n\nThen I fucked up and caught feelings. \n\nHere's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work.\n\nTL;DR:",

I've been in the band for about a year now and it's been really fun, but lately I just don't see it going anywhere and I am getting increasingly annoyed by my bandmates. The reason I joined was because the old guitarist who was an original member quit and they needed a new guitarist\/songwriter. Since the time I've been in the band, we've gone through 2 drummers and our current drummer is alright, but he's very young and still not quite at the right skill level. Our singer is the only original member, so it's like \"his band\" but to be honest, he seems to care the least about everything. He's completely ignorant about music and about equipment and he really brings nothing to the table since he is consistently broke and not a very bright dude.\n\nThis is where the situation gets sticky. I currently live with the bass player, we have an apartment together and our lease is up in September. Our friendship is basically based off the band, so I'm afraid that if I quit, he's going to be mega pissed at me. I would try to explain how I feel about the whole situation to him but he's kind of stubborn and I predict he will throw a shit fit about the whole thing.\n\nI've worked my ass off holding this band together and I just don't see the point anymore when it's mainly me doing all the work. I do most of the writing, the band uses my van to transport gear, so that means that I am always the one driving and responsible for loading\/unloading. A lot of the time I'll get fucked over by one or more of the other guys in the band and have to unload all the gear with just one other person, while the other guys go out to another show or to a bar.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, just looking for some advice to handle this situation as best as possible so I can stay friends with these guys.\n\nTL;DR:",

We have been texting frequently and seeing each other multiple times a week. \n\nWe are both extremely busy and dedicated to our school work, which I like, but she also competitively figure skates. So here's the problem, this week on top of tests\/assignments\/practice etc she also has a big competition that she has said she hasn't had a lot of time to prepare for. I have no figure skating experience, so I can't really feel her pain and I feel like I can't really give her legitimate support. Even worse, her schedule is completely blocked up this week so she can only text. It would be ok if I could see her to tell her it'll be ok, but I really don't know what I can really say texting trying to make her feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, since we started talking, messaging has been pretty consistent. But in the days leading up to the competition, she's been kind of short and dispersed with her communication. I've been giving her space and not texting because I know she's busy, and she's been starting conversations at night. Even though I know she's unbelievably busy, I can't help but feel she is being a little distant. \n\n---\n\nSo tonight is her big night. What the hell can I text her if she tells me she totally bombed her routine? \n\nAlso, do you think the distance could be because she's possibly losing interest? Or am I just paranoid haha. We have a date Monday after she's done everything, I plan on casually asking her about why she was being a little distant when we go out.\n\nTL;DR:",

(I don't want to put the burden of life onto someone else either!) I discussed it with my friends and came down to \"enjoy your time here while you can\", so I decided I'd focus on the things I love, which are videogames and sex.\n\n With my GF and I going to seperate colleges in a month, I figured that this would be the end and I would be able to finally get my sex life going and have some fun. (We will be 12hrs apart by car)\n\n So now that I'm overseas I thought I'd visit an erotic massage place and enjoy myself. I recieved unprotected fellatio for 20seconds before I suggested that she wrap it up. We then had protected intercourse. \n\n It was not very enjoyable. It made me realize sex is not just about pleasing yourself or your partner but its about the special connection you share. I really regret not rubbing one out before I left that day.\n\n When I got home that night I realized I had betrayed my SO's trust and I cried thinking about it. How it would hurt her knowing I did this. I realized how special she is to me. (I'm tearing up as I write this.)\n\n I sent her a message that night telling her how much she meant to me and I would stay in a long distance relationship so that we could move in together and that I will stay loyal to her for four years. I meant it and I mean it forever, this experienced changed me for the better.

The summary of the situation is this: I met a female gamer playing an mmo who is currently married with two kids  and is in an emotionally abusive marriage. She has been in this marriage for 10 years. My insecurities caused a rift and our contact has become strained. \n\nWe became close, feelings were very strong and we professed our mutual love for each other. We chatted and Skyped often. \n\nIn time, though, my insecurities and unease with the situation placed stress upon us both which has brought me to where we are. I tried to break off contact two weeks ago and stated as such. She was devastated and I ended up being unable to follow through. We decided our best bet was to try and remove the emotional side from it and I have been unable to do so.\n\nI've really struggled with everything. I feel like I love this woman and I know that my constant worries and questions caused the rift. It became very hard to not feel sad when her husband would call and interrupt our Skype sessions. Or when she suddenly changed factions in the game we played and seemed no longer wanting to play with me. I would make my feelings known and she tried to reassure me. It all became too much, as she felt as if it wasn't enough and she couldn't be enough. \n\nThis past week, I told her that I couldn't handle just being friends right now and I should try to take some space. She explained that she doesn't feel the same as she once did and she doesn't know what the future holds. She said she isn't able to write things off for good yet but space and time are important. \n\nMy questions are this:\n\nIs there hope or is it worth holding out hope for a future? \nAm I wrong to feel so bad about how I handled the situation?\nHow can I overcome my insecurities relative to this situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

He just couldn't be in a relationship right now\n\nI understood this, and knowing his past and his problems this made a lot of sense. He was treating me pretty bad the last year of our relationship (i don't mean abusive) just inconsiderate and consumed with his own issues.\n\nWell, two days ago I found out he was seriously dating another woman and I feel absolutely shattered. The break-up was a good thing, for both of us, but I'm stunned he's already dating seriously. \n\nI feel hurt because I truly felt for him and the tough time he was going through, I cried with him, and now I feel like it was all bullshit.

Over the the years, she began to live more 'ghetto' lifestyle; welfare, drugs, boyfriend who beat her, went to jail... etc. She recently got married to him, and my father chose to NOT attend the wedding because he was morally against her marrying this individual. \n\nLast year, She was told that she was absolutely welcome at our annual Christmas gathering on Christmas eve. (So long as her SO was not in attendance) Given this relatively strict stipulation, she could not agree to leaving him at home alone last year, but this year, she came to me, as her sister, asking if I could talk to my dad about having her over for christmas.\n\nI spent the entire time trying to convince her that it would NOT be a problem and that, OF COURSE, she would be welcome to attend the family gathering. \n\nLow and behold.. my Dad is NOT okay with this situation. I spend an entire afternoon crying about this situation trying to deal with the estranged relationship that has developed between my dad and my sister.

She's a virgin, and I'm a virgin. Hell, she's so innocent, it's not even funny.\n\nBut, we've recently started to get a lot more physical. From about the second week, we've been sleeping together. As in, we would cuddle and then sleep in the same bed. We might make out a little bit, but it was mostly the cuddling and the sleeping.\n\nThen, I started with the dry-humping, and she reciprocated, and clothes started coming off. Only above the waist, however. I quickly learned how to properly take off a bra.\n\nAnd then, just within this last week, we moved to third base. It started with me rubbing outside of the shorts she wore to bed, and then I asked if she minded me moving inside the shorts, and she said no, so I did. And she's given me a handjob before too. Mostly, though, I feel like it's been me.\n\nAnd I want it, in the moment. And she wants it--she never hasn't wanted it. But, afterwards, I always feel like shit. I wouldn't say I regret it, but I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for initiating it, and for almost pushing the boundaries.\n\nI guess, what I'm asking here more than anything, is that should this be happening? Is this one of those things that should just *feel* right from the moment you're doing it? Like, when you're doing it and when you're not? As bad as this sounds, could it be a sign that she's not really \"the one\" and that, knowing that, I should break up with her?\n\nTL;DR:",

He was interested in her, and she basically had no interest in him. She said yes, but only as friends. Even after this he clearly still had feelings for her. She didn't really have any interest in dating him, but she thought maybe she'd try going on a couple dates with him. She wasn't sure if she genuinely wasn't interested or she was just scared because she hadn't really had any relationship experience before. \n\nI know this guy because we have a class together and we sit together. He's somewhat shy, but sweet and funny. We've spent some time together, we co-led a group of kids at a volunteer event, and obviously I'm around him every day. I definitely have at least some feelings for him, and I can't really tell if he reciprocates, he's just generally a very quiet person.\n\nHim and my friend's sister went on a few dates, and as it turned out it was somewhat awkward and very very platonic. Neither of them attempted to make any move on the other, and things were generally very tense. Like, sitting down and having a pro-cons conversation about kissing eachother and then not kissing eachother tense. She plans on breaking whatever this is off with him the next time she sees him, but she doesn't even know if this will be necessary because they haven't even hung out in a month. Any interest that either of them had is dead.\n\nAs I said earlier, I kind of like this guy. Graduation is soon and we'll soon be going our separate ways, though we'll still be in the same area. Should I just give him my number, whether it turns out to be platonic or not? Or should I just steer clear?\n\nTL;DR:",

She called it off giving the usual bullshit about how she didn't want a relationship having recently come out of a three year one, \"it's me not you\", \"I would in different circumstances\"... I was devestated and refused to give it up. \n\nI trust very few people with details about my love life but this friend of mine Jack is one of them. I thought he didn't keep many secrets from me but he mentioned a couple of times about this girl that he was seeing in college. He wouldn't tell me who it was, instead saying that first I had to tell him the name of the girl I slept with that nobody knows about (I don't like telling people about that kind of thing).\n\nLast night I asked another close mate of ours who the girl was and he told me it was this girl I had been so into. Of course Jack can see whoever he wants but I am so angry that he at least didn't have the respect for me to tell me that it was happening. He actively tried to keep it a secret from me whilst everyone else knew. I would follow the rules and state the duration but I have no idea. I was left still trying to chase this girl and embarrassing myself in front of everyone.\n\nI was in such a bad way last night that the police had to come and put me under watch so that I didn't attempt to harm myself or kill myself.\n\nIs my anger justified?

Things are going really well, we have a great time when we go out, she seems really into it - and then out of nowhere, COMPLETELY severs all contact. No explanation, seemingly at random. There doesn't appear to be a triggering event, we can go from planning our next date to utter radio silence at the drop of a hat. I've been on my fair share of bad dates, and these were not bad dates.\n\nOther than this pattern, nothing is really that similar between the women. They're a variety of ages, personality types, and even races. Some of them I've slept with on the second or third date. Some I haven't. All of them I've at least made out with, at least one of them initiated making out with me, in a pub while playing darts no less. It's pretty clear that they're interested in me.\n\nI generally consider myself pretty good at picking up on social cues, body language, etc. I can take the hint when someone doesn't want to talk to me. I usually use the rule of two missed texts and one missed call before I give up trying to maintain contact. I'm very much not a needy or smothering person, I respect distance and personal space, especially at the beginning of a relationship.\n\nI really like these girls, and I get the feeling that they like me. Could I be doing something wrong? Is this some sort of test to see if I'll keep pursuing them? I have a pretty thick shell, but it hurts more and more each time this happens, and it's very discouraging to stay in the dating game.

If I get sick, do I have the right to be mad?\nPOST: I [23M] need advice on how to handle this situation. My roommate [23M] and I live in a small two bedroom apartment. He has his GF over probably 5 nights a week. It doesn't bother me. But now she has the flu and has pretty much not left our apartment for more than a couple hours for the past 6 days. She lives on a boat that I've never seen but I think is in disrepair - hence her staying over so much. I get that staying in his bed is probably the best place for her recovery (as opposed to on the boat) but I feel like I'm starting to come down with something. Do I have the right to be pissed at him if I catch what she has?\n\nI've been good friends with my roommate since childhood and I get along with his (relatively new) GF pretty well too. If she had her own apartment I wouldn't feel bad telling him that she needs to stay away until she's better, but since she's living on a unfinished boat, I feel like telling him she has to go would be like throwing her out on the street. Every twenty minutes I can hear her coughing up a lung. I know the flu virus doesn't transmit via surfaces very well, but I don't think she covers her mouth when she coughs. She also doesn't work so is here 24\/7 and smokes weed multiple times a day - which I can't imagine helps her coughing get better faster.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

Now I'm not getting payed for the hours that I worked for another two weeks. (Nebraska)\nPOST: Hello all, thanks in advance for any advice you may have.\n\nLet me preface this by letting you know that I am currently working an hourly security position for a state College in Nebraska. We are part time (30hrs\/week), hand in our timestamps every Monday and are paid bi-weekly.\n\nChristmas break for employees at the college I work for was from 12-23-2014 to 1-5-2015. However, the Department I work in (Security) does not get any of this time off and I ended up working my regular hours and I filled out my time-stamp and turned it in on time. On Monday the 5th of January 2015 (when college employees returned), my manager turned in all of the timestamps from our department, and found out that the people in charge of payroll decided that they didn't have time to process all 6 of them and told us that we would have to wait until the 22nd of January to get paid. \n\nWhat exacerbates this is that before break my manager was informed that if all time-sheets were turned in on the first day back from break, that they would be processed and put on the payday for the 8th of January. \n\nSo, as a student already struggling to make ends meet and bills to pay, I'm sitting here getting half of what I should be getting payed on the 8th of January.\n\nI had a meeting with the lady who is charge of payroll, and over the course of the better part of an hour, all that I got from her was a \"Well, you guys are just going to have to wait until the 22nd, there's nothing I can do.\" \n\nWhat steps, if any, can I take here? I did everything right on my end, so I feel like there should be something that I can do. Thanks a ton!\n\nTL;DR:",

My roommate, AZ, recently got nudes from some girl he's interested in and showed them to us. Which is great! On a side note, it is important to the story to know that I hooked up with her last semester, not to AZ's knowledge. \n\nToday, I get a series of messages from AZ, asking why I sent myself nudes of this girl from his phone and ipad. It is worth noting, that I, did not in fact do this. I double checked my phone: No nudes. I inform him, and send him screenshots of my gallery, which is a barren wasteland of no tits or ass. He gets back to the dorm, and shows me his ipad (which he also leaves unlocked apparently) and his phone. On his phone, our messages clearly indicate that someone sent me nudes at some point in time. On his ipad, the evidence is deleted. I show him my phone, and he does not believe me, which is reasonable. \n\nMy personal theory is that someone sent them on his ipad, deleted the pictures on my phone, and then deleted the messages on the ipad, knowing he would still have the imessage on his phone, and making it look like I tried to delete them. The rest of my suitemates, knowing I hooked up with her, are now also suspicious, and now I'm the scumbag of my suite with no way to prove my innocence.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'd love some input.\nPOST: My gf finally gave up on me about a month ago. I've been talking to my parents about this and would like some more perpective.\n\nI was raised by a father with aspergers. He was raised by an ASD mother and bipolar father. Needless to say he didn't have the best examples to learn from considering observation is his main method of learning emotional\/loving interaction. My mother tried to compensate for it as best she could, but I think that lead to an overbearing type of love that really has affected me as well. \n\nAnyway. I lived in a VERY religious household until 20. Once I was out I latched onto a woman I met and we got married at quickly. About 5 years later she divorced me. I met another woman and latched on again. Once again she left me. \n\nSo. My recent realization as to what is ruining my relationships (and actual question) is that I have A LOT OF trouble realizing that someone loves and cares about me. I had the two extremes with my parents and reject love in all forms now. I don't trust\/believe people that say they admire me or see anything good in me. \n\nQuestion part: What can I do to deal with this? Anyone else in a similar situation? I feel that I don't know how to feel loved or tell that someone really loves me. It's ruining relationships with friends, family, gfs, coworkers, etc. I seem to follow that same pattern over and over and I'm tired of it.\n\nI've also dealt with depression\/anxiety for years, but I don't believe those are the roots of my current issues. I think this is a deeper root that I would like to explore and welcome any and all input.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm not, honestly this whole thing feels completely vapid, every time we kiss or even just talk I don't feel like I'm getting any satisfaction, and that I may as well be talking to an inanimate object. Her replies to things are rarely longer than a few words, and even sex felt rather dull when we got round to it.\n\nSo yeah, I took heed of this and decided to tell her that it wasn't working, she cried a bit, and we generally left on good terms, it all felt pretty decent. Then I did a really piss-poor thing and decided to get back with her. Why? Because I felt bad, and I won't deny that this whole thing is anybody else's fuck up than mine.\n\nNow to the actual question: What do? Going in and simply breaking up with her again would look ridiculous, and would most certainly put us on bad terms with each other for the foreseeable future, considering that we have a few close mutual friends, that would also cause complications.

I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.\n\nI got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.\n\nWhen I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.\n\nBut here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old \"normal\" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace! I only stopped because I didn't want to go from zero to 60 and risk reinjury. I feel like a million bucks!\n\nTL;DR:",

I refused to let him into my home without a warrant, to which he replied he didn't need one on welfare calls. Reddit, what are my rights in this sort of situation? (X-post fromAskReddit)\nPOST: Hello, I was informed I should cross-post this here.\n\nI live in Texas, and I'm sitting in my study at 1 AM playing a computer game when there is a knock on my door. Now, I don't live in the best part of town, and I'm somewhat of a paranoid man, so I refuse to open the door not knowing whether he was actually an officer or not (It also didn't help that I had no peep-hole and no way to see if he was who he said he was). The officer then claims he is responding to a call about unattended children and wants to come in and look around. I tell him there are no children here but informed him that \"I'd be happy to let you in if you have a warrant, but without one I do not give permission to enter my home.\" He then informs me that on a welfare call he does not need a warrant to enter my home and then threatens to break the door down. I stand my ground and tell him he may not enter without a warrant, which is followed by silence. In this time I go to another room and look out of the window, see the badge and gun, and then go outside to meet him. It turns out the caller hadn't given him the full address and he was at the wrong place. He then (in a very polite and respectful manner) informs me he does not need a warrant to enter my home on a welfare call.\n\nReddit, is this true? If so, then what are my rights if this happens again? Care to expand my knowledge (and most likely that of others) of what to do in this situation?\n\nTL;DR:",
    "output_1": "Police knock on your door at 1:00 AM for an \"unattended children\" welfare check. You refuse to let them in without a warrant, they claim they don't need one for welfare checks, and threaten to break down the door. Are your rights being violated? Do you have any options?",

    "output_2": "TL;DR: Last night, the police conducted a welfare check at your home, claiming it was due to unattended children. They requested entry, but you refused without a warrant. The officer threatened to break down the door, but eventually left without entering. Upon checking the caller's information, the officer realized they had the wrong address. In Texas, officers may conduct welfare checks without a warrant but do not have the right to enter your home without your consent. Your rights in this situation would be to remain silent and not consent to a search without a warrant.",

I'm sure you've seen this sort of behavior, someone talking about how great things are now compared to *before,* how great it is to be finally understood, etc.\n\nSo I know it would be trouble to engage with this; it's probably what she wants. I've unsubscribed, so I can only see her updates when I look for them, which I do out of morbid curiosity every three or four days. Most of the time, they just cement my convictions about making the right choice in leaving her. Others, it makes me feel crappy, because sometimes the things she says have a grain of truth. There's a part of me that thinks not blocking her is a point of pride; I'm showing that I don't care. Another part of me thinks it might make me feel better to block her.

I accidently bumped into her, as for her reaction she made a painful and shocked expression. She then starts to scream at me of how careful I should be and I could've hurt her child. ( I don't think bumping into her would've hurt her child in anyway considering she was the only one that was hit, and all her children were at the side.) She screams of how painful her ankle was and telling me that it has a giant bruise and hoe much of an idiot I am. Being a 16 year old I decided to be mature and tell her I was very sorry over and over. As I widh this fight would be solved, my mother started to scream outloud in front of the crowd at the woman for ( As a 16 year old I look older than I look) screaming at me. Soon enough the womans husband come and joins in saying I was being irresponsible for not being careful and was being a mature young man taking responsibility. In my head I did not want their kids and my mom,s and her friend to hear this because obviously the woman started to use profanity in front of the children. I tried to to stop this fight but my mother refused, after about another 10 minutes of bickering she finally gave up and called her a fuck head as her last parting words. I wish it would've been handled more peacefully, but it could'nt have been helped. Never some people would cone out so aggressivley in public.\n\nTL;DR:",

For those who haven't heard of that app: it enables whoever you allow to track where you are at any time, set an alert if you are on the move, and has a few other features.\n\nHer reasoning: I often go (kite)surfing in remote locations and this way she'll know where I am in case of emergency. And she recently did a long Coastrek where I helped with support and she thought in hindsight that this app would have helped me find where she was.\n\nI'm a little creeped out by it. IMO my wife has insecurity and trust issues, and this is just a way for her to reassure herself that I'm not cheating on her whenever I work late etc.\n\nI've 'let her' instal it - for now, to give her the reassurances she seems to need. But I did voice my opinion on the matter, explaining that I perceive it to be a creepy little stalking tool that I can understand using on your teenage children's phone, but not on your husband. I told her to feel free to instal it but that I perceive it as her having trust issues, to which her response was that my 'defensive manner' was suspicious in itself.\n\nI asked if she knew of any other friends who use it (none), and who else she tracks on her Find a Friend app (only her brother).\n\nAs a side note and to provide context: we have been married for 5 years, have 2 kids and an almost barren sex life (which I gather is pretty normal for 'married with kids' couples) - which I think makes her insecure about my fidelity. And no; I'm not cheating on her. \n\nAm I handling this the right way? Any constructive advice welcomed.\n\nTL;DR:",

My dog (whose previous issue was ankle-biting) is a 2 or 3 year old lab\/basset hound cross. She was adopted from a shelter and has some separation anxiety issues (which we are dealing with), and is generally very very needy.\n\nThe trouble I am coming across in recent weeks is this: She sleeps in the bedroom, as she will NEVER be in a different room from me by choice, in her crate beside the bed. (Not closed in; that is just where she likes to sleep.) As soon as it is even sort of light outside, she begins pacing around the bed and whining incessantly.\n\nAt first I stuck with ignoring her and waiting for her to settle down and then giving her some attention (I didn't have any treats on hand, though maybe keeping some on the nightstand is not a bad plan). The trouble with that method is that she never actually settles down. She just gets increasingly louder until it reaches the point where she is flat out barking and howling.\n\nI am concerned about this because when I do finally get up (as I have no choice but to do), I am probably indicating to her that whining and barking is the way to get someone out of bed. I know it is not a case of having to go outside, as she calms down immediately when someone gets up.\n\nI am at a loss about the cause of this and how to fix it.

I inserted each segment of the pole into the end of the other, but ultimately when I held it vertically the weight of it pulled it apart. Pulled it back up, scotch taped each joint (no good tape in the apartment, of course), gave it another 20 minutes, and bam, knocked it to the ground and went down and got it.

All the while my friends at the bar are dropping subtle hints to her about \"how good it is to see him out having a good time\" how \"this is really helping him move forward\" \"he really needs something like this\". I called my ex who lived down the street and hated him come by and wait for the right time in my room. They come back go into his room we're all on the couch and after a few minutes we hear him tell her \"no none of this is mine, she's not my girlfriend\"  \"I've never made a girl get an abortion\" i grab my ex and tell her to start banging on the front door  and call \"mike a coward\" \"a pro-choicer\" \"and the least he could do is pay for the abortion like he promised\" needless to say the girl storms out of the place, he runs after her, he comes back in and we all start busting up laughing he gets pissed slams his door and finally lightens up the next day about it.\n\nTL;DR:",

I was bored, and home alone, and decided it would be a really fun idea to go exploring our garage, where my dad usually likes to sit and smoke. It's pretty cluttered usually, but, as my parents' wedding is coming up it's been cleaned out this month. I walk in, and look around. I see what I would usually expect to see, tools, cans, used cigarettes and the like, and so I walk over to the desk. I look it over, and find that nothing out of place seems to be there until I look down and see, right underneath a small spanner, a syringe needle. I can tell that it's used, as it's pushed all the way in. My brain instantly jumps to conclusions, but I'm hesitant to believe what my instincts tell me until I look to my right and see two spoons, along with a kettle on the floor. The spoons seem stained. \n\nI'm not sure what to think, or do. I've found a weed grinder of my dad's lying around before, and I've been told that my dad has done some crazy shit in his past, so I know he's open to the idea of drug use (albeit on a much more minor scale) and I didn't care about that, but something like this has left me feeling awkward and concerned for my dad. What if I'm wrong, and the needle was used for something else? Should I ask him? Should I potentially let him continue? I know my dad's job is extremely stressful and if it's his way of coping, I don't necessarily want to stop him. All in all not a colossal fuck up but I certainly wish I hadn't been so nosy.\n\nTL;DR:",

We've had a lighter month than usual, and a few people were commenting that they didn't work as much because of it. What should have been 80 hours, was more like 70-75. One person barely broke 60. \n\nI noticed my boss had 80+ hours, even though she took two half-days during this pay period. She over compensated her paid time off (PTO). She added time to her half-days so that she had close to 10 hours for each of her days off, even though she didn't put in more than 8 hours a day at work this whole month (she worked closer to 7 hrs a day). She is constantly complaining about the budget and complains when we (the employees) need supplies (you know, for our jobs). I feel like she's cheating the company by taking extra time off she didn't earn, and even getting some over time when she's pretty much the only one (there is a specialist who has the most work out of everyone regardless). I'm not mad she took PTO, I'm mad because she intentionally set it for more than 8 hours to boost her paycheck. \n\nThe problem is, I can't do anything about it. I have a very low position and I hold no sway. I can't tell the higher ups in the company\/corporation, because she's in good with all of them and it will just come back to bite me. I can't tell the other employees because that will just start more drama and tension in the office.

Now, you see, my job is interesting and all, but it's an office job and I feel I'm not suited for this. I'm the adventures type, I want something happening around me and going to work from 9 to 6 is just killing me.\n\nThe one thing that I thought of is a bike trip mostly in Europe, Asia and North Africa. The problem is that I'm from a country with an average salary around 350 euros or 450 USD. My salary is a bit higher - around 450 euros, but still not enough according to what I read is needed for such a trip, witch is about 30000 USD.\n\nMy question is if somebody has done something like this without any money and if they have some tips for me. I'm thinking about sleeping outdoors or helping some locals for food and a place to crash. Is this something that could work out? I'm planning to go with my girlfriend and I think not too many people would take us in.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTL;DR:",

So her and my sister left to go find one. They came back after renting a movie and put it in. Now as a kid I was a huge pussy, like scared of his own shadow kind of thing. Now if you had read the Goosbump stories as a little kid you will know they are actually fucked.. well my sister had gotten the movie \"The Werewolf of Fever Swamp\" and after about 25 minutes of watching the movie I was fucking terrified. My sister got to scared and went upstairs and it was only me sitting on the couch in a dark room shitting my pants. Now I would of gone upstairs but I was to scared to turn my head (yes I was a pussy) fearing that their was a Werewolf sitting right behind me getting ready to eat me as soon as I looked backwards. Now if you have seen the movie then you would know that their is a scene when the character is running from the Werewolf and the Werewolf falls into a pit of quicksand or something. Well I had recurring nightmares until I was 14 from that scene. I would wake up in a swamp and see a Werewolf running at me and I would start to run away, the Werewolf would easily catch me and then try to eat my face and as it went in for the bite I would wake up sweating and terrified. Eventually these went away after I watched the \"Haunting of Connecticut\" and yes I did go run into my parents room crying about fucking dead people.. oh god how young and innocent and such a huge pussy I was.\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I meet and talk to girls?\nPOST: My parents have always been overprotective, the only time I really get to see my friends is school r during sporting games, literally no other time.\n\nWe live in a small town of about 3000 people.\n\nBut ever since I got my drivers license, I've been completely free to do anything for some reason.\n\nIn school I'm really not one of those kids who's quiet and doesn't talk to people, I'm actually surprisingly \"popular\" and outgoing, despite not seeing my friends very much at all. \n\nThat being said, I think the reason for this is because it's a really small town and school that I've become familiar with, seeing the same faces every single day.\n\nI really want to go out in the world and into some cities very close to where I live to meet some new people and possibly find a relationship (I'm too good of friends with everybody in my town for them to be relationship possibilities)\n\nThat being said, I need your help. First, where are cool places to meet girls my age to just befriend and possibly something more? The other thing I need help with is just preparing myself mentally for this change in not being overly protected and going out and doing all of this relationship type stuff that I have no experience in whatsoever. I feel as though it's just a more intimate version of friendship. But I can't be sure.\n\nTL;DR:",

We hit it off and after a few messages I asked her out to dinner in which she replied \"I'm really busy for the next couple weeks, but I'll see what I can do\". I figure she's letting me down nicely and never expect to hear from her again.\n\nFour days later she messages me back with her number! Word. We text back and forth a few times over the next few days and I ask her out one more time and I get the same sort of response. However, I figure she's being honest because she not only gave me her number in the first place, but has talked about sex, that she wanted to teach me how to dance, and all this other stuff that proved she was really interested. If anything, the fact she keeps responding to me, someone she's never even met, tells me she's being honest.\n\nSo after this, I go on vacation to Florida where I am currently (it's been almost two weeks). I asked her if she was busy next week again, but made a rookie mistake, gave her another thread at the same time, and she latched onto that instead of the real inquiry I was interested in. Oh well. A few days later (about 3 or 4 days ago) I ask her again and she replies \"I'll see what I can do :)\".\n\nSo here I am today. I get back on Friday. I've been talking to this girl somewhat for roughly 3 weeks. What do I say to get her to commit to a date on Saturday? If she gives me another iffy response should I keep trying MORE? I mean as long as she's responding, she's clearly interested right? I just don't want to come off as pathetic seeing as this is like the 4th time I've asked her out.\n\nTL;DR:",

Basically, I was with a guy for a bit over three years (August 2007-October 2010) and our relationship was excellent, but then he got offered an internship that meant that he had to move away for a year. We decided our relationship was so excellent that we would be able to handle long distance for a year. \n\nI moved apartments (we had lived together before - couldn't afford rent on my own), and became friends with this guy that lived across the hall. Over the next six months I steadily started falling for him, and realized I wasn't being \"emotionally faithful\" to the first guy anymore, so I ended it when he came home for Thanksgiving in October (we're Canadians).  \n\nIn December, I started dating the new guy that lived across the hall. Since we basically lived in the same apartment, we got to be together all the time and that was definitely fun...\n\nBut then, in February, my mom got diagnosed with cancer and I had to move home to help her out for a few months (Parents are divorced, I'm an only child).  My new guy decided that he would be okay with long distance, since I'd be moving back in May (hopefully). \n\nTwo weeks ago, he broke up with me because he wasn't feeling it anymore.\n\nThe problem is now that I'm just really angry with myself for throwing away my relationship with my old guy for this new one. Old guy was okay to hold on to me for a whole year when we were long-distance, but new guy couldn't even hold on for two more months. \n\nI guess I'm just really angry because I feel like I wasted my time, and for chose the wrong guy, and really just for a bunch of things. I know I should just chalk it up to \"life experience\" or whatever, but I'm having a hard time doing that. Advice for getting over myself? I know that it was wrong to drop old guy for new one, so I don't need to hear people berating me for that, thanks.  \n\nI'm F24, old guy was M24, new guy was M23.\n\nTL;DR:",

When I called back he said he'd call me back in a bit. So I'm farting around, looking for something to do. Watched TV in the basement for a short time and went back upstairs. I was chilling in my bed, messing with my phone when he called. He asked if he could run something by me and I asked if it was beer because I was out of beer. We decided that I'd just go over to his house so I could drink his beer and he could run something by me. When I went outside, I smelled something burning. Not just *something* burning, but it smelled like cigarette butts burning. I had recently smoked a cigarette on the back porch and outside the basement door, so I went to check. Nothing happening on the back porch, but there was a softball size glowing red wad of cigarette butts where I put my cigarette out about 10-15 minutes earlier. I realize now how unsafe our \"ash tray\" is now because it is just a flimsy plastic thing that a plant would come in, it was over stuffed with cigarette butts AND it was sitting in a bed of pine straw! So I grab the hose and easily extinguish this glowing butt fireball of death and breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nSo who knows what would have happened if I hadn't decided to go to my friends house at about that time. I would've come outside within the next half hour or so to smoke, an hour at the most and would have smelled it then if it was still smoldering. But like I said, it was a glowing ball of death in a bed of pine straw, so it could have easily ignited and then who knows what would have happened.\n\nOh, and my wife is out of town. Imagine making that call. Honey, umm, I uh, I burned the house down. *shiver* Can't even think about the fact that all 4 of my kids were home at this time.\n\nI will absolutely get a can of some sorts to put our butts in to reduce the risk. Should just fucking quit smoking.\n\nThanks dude. Oh, he was contemplating refininancing his house and wanted to discuss it with me.\n\nTL;DR:",

I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:\nEach summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech\/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.\n\nSo, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.\n\nOK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:\nNonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),\n\nSocial and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,\n\nTriple Bottom Line Fund,\n\nSocially Responsible Internship Fund.\n\nSee, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.\n\nTL;DR:",

I work full time(50+hrs\/week), and she works\/goes to school full time\n\n.\nBefore we got together, she said that school comes first and foremost, and I agreed. So the relationship as a whole went great, we were hanging out a lot, sex was awesome, and for the 1st time in my life I felt truly happy. Well the sex slowed to an eventual stop. She started pulling away from me. This was off and on until a few weeks, and I noticed something was up, then she basically told me how she was super stressed and needed space.\n\nI asked her if her feelings for me changed, and she said they weren't as strong as they were a month ago. I gave her the chance on multiple times to end it, but she didn't. After a week of hell, she sent me a long drawn out text saying how she felt like she was dragging a ball of chain, and how she felt like she had to report to me because I'd ask her questions like, how was your day?, what are you up to?, she didn't like small talk texting everyday because it was distracting.\n\nI would ask her to hangout on certain days that way I can still see her and give her the space she needs. She said that ultimately that wasn't reasonable for her, and that all she asked is for time to sort her shit out. Since the text, we went out to dinner, and still say goodnight\/morning and talk a little bit, but I want to get back to where we were.\n\nI have been fighting through this because ultimately I feel that this is worth fighting for, and I don't simply believe in giving up and breaking up when things get rough. She doesn't take any bs, so I feel as though if she were going to break up with me after all this shit, she would have by now. Ultimately I need help reddit, what can I do to fix this?\n\nTL;DR:",

To make a long story short I got her number, we went out on one date a week ago which I think went pretty well (although it only ended in a hug which is fine I guess because I had only known her for a few days). We started texting\/calling back and forth and she seemed into me (long thoughtful responses, exclamation marks, the odd emoji). I asked her out on a second date a week ago and she said yes. The date was set to be today, the day after our second freshman meetup so I texted her saying something along the lines of \"Aren't I lucky I get to spend two days in a row with you!\" to which she responded positively.\n\nOur second date was to be today, the day after another first year meetup. I wasn't particularly flirty with her at the meetup but when I got home I sent her a text saying something along the lines of \"I gotta be up early because I'm lucky enough to be spending the afternoon with a special someone! Night!\". A short while afterwords she said she couldn't meet up because her sister (who doesn't live with her, she lives alone) grounded her for not finishing her calculus assignments. When I asked her how her sister could ground her if she doesn't live with her she said \"she told her everything\". I'm not entirely sure if this is bullshit because she is really busy with this course she's taking (she was even doing work at the meetup last night). I said \"that's too bad some other time\". \n\nNow I'm not really sure what to do. I'm going on vacation tomorrow and likely won't be texting her and she hasn't texted me today. I don't know if I should text her tonight or just give up on her. I'm really not sure why I did wrong because she seemed really into me the night before the meetup. What do I do? Am I pretty much shit out of luck? Why has she suddenly changed her mind?\n\nTL;DR:",

We had only been together for like 6 months, but she was actually my first serious relationship.  We were best friends, and I became very emotionally invested.  When she ended things, it seemed out of the blue for me.  I still don't really know what happened, she just told me that she felt like we were \"incompatible.\" \n\nAt the advice of every single one of my friends, I did the best I could to ignore her and separate myself from her.  I found that I could only do this for so long (2-3 weeks max) before one of us caved and started talking to the other.  \n\nA few days ago she made a vague comment that I (apparently wrongly) interpreted to mean that she still has feelings for me.  We were talking a lot in the days since, and things felt just like old times.  However, I talked to her and found out that she is definitely not interested, so I feel like I'm back at square one.  \n\nI have no idea why it's so difficult for me to move on. I find myself thinking about pointless things like how much she cares about me, how much she ever cared about me, how happy she is without me, etc.  I feel like I'm just torturing myself but I don't know how to stop.\n\nShe also told me that she finds it hurtful \/ emotionally difficult when I stop talking to her.  I just feel like as long as I still want a relationship with her and she still doesn't, we're just on uneven footing and it's just hurting me more.\n\nI find myself totally unable to just cut her out, and since I keep trying and failing, it's just hurting us both.  I don't really have any idea what to do, I think my friends are all sick of hearing me mope about it.  I can't seem to snap out of it and it's really taking a toll.\n\nTL;DR:",

I knew he was beaten as a child (with a whip) by his father, but then again, so was I. I assumed his father stopped, and that it was a cultural thing, as he had lived in Israel until two years ago. Andy and his uncle had been eating at a restaurant when he was a child, and there was a terror attack. Andy's uncle protected Andy and died in the process, causing Andy's father to blame him for his brother's death.\n\nI recently learned that the beatings have not stopped. They have instead continued to grow worse, and he is whipped with a belt for things like coming home late or having his music on too loud. At one point, when Andy's father knew Andy and I had kissed, he beat Andy with a belt until his back bled and threw him outside the house until midnight (I am Indian, and Andy's father would prefer he be a with a white, Jewish girl).\n\nI've told my mother what is happening to Andy. She had been abused by her father as a child, so I thought she would understand. She said that Andy is probably lying and that if something was really happening, Andy should tell someone. She said I am being naive, and that if this is really happening to him, it's only an incentive for him to move out when he turns 18. She walked in on us kissing (it was our first kiss, so it wasn't like we were making out) and now she thinks he just wants to use me and is manipulating me.\n\nToday, he asked his father if he could come to my house. He says his father broke his rib and said no when he asked. I told my mother this, asking if I should call an ambulance or something. She said it's his problem, not mine, and that if he wants help, he should do it himself. \n\nIs she right? I really don't have any proof other than his texts to me, but abusers are good at hiding what they do. Should I keep it to myself?\n\nTL;DR:",

An opportunity to live in her former home of Seattle emerged, and we converged our careers there. A year into our living together, she was unhappy with her job and started traveling for work as a consultant 4x a week. I basically see her on weekends.\n\nSix months ago she was obsessed with a big, beautiful new house in San Antonio and seemed convinced that would be where we'll start a new chapter in our life. So we bought the house (we both contributed equally) and I convinced my employer to let me move my job down there. So far so good. One month before we're ready to move she gets misgivings about Texas, saying she didn't like the culture.\n\nNow my wife has accepted a new job in San Diego. So I'm making elaborate plans -- for the second time this year -- to transfer my career to a new location. It's not easy.\n\nTonight she said that if I don't like living there (who wouldn't like San Diego?) or if it's too much hassle for me to move my job that she's \"done\" adjusting her life to make me happy. She says I was bitter and difficult about adjusting to Seattle, and I 'ruined' the experience of living there by not agreeing to buy a house right away.\n\nThis floors me... as it seems I am the one doing all the adjusting to her changing demands. She says if she changes her mind about San Diego after a year or two, she's moving back to Seattle. \n\nFor the last two years she's also discussed getting a divorce for financial reasons (we get hit pretty hard with taxes, but the suggestion hurts..)\n\nTL;DR:",

For example, I've been playing guitar for about 8 years. I'm good, I know I'm good. But I'm not NEARLY as good as I should be after 8 years. And its because I never truly dedicated myself to it. Even though I love it, I never had the ability to say \"fuck school\/work\/friends, I'm just gonna sit and practice guitar for 2-3 hours per day\". Maybe it's unrealistic to think that a college student can consistently fit that into their schedule. Maybe it's just the personality I was born with. \n\nAnyway,\n\nTL;DR:",

Stuck in a weird situation and not sure what to do.\nPOST: I'm a 27 year old male and work at a store with a 19 year old female. Over the past few months, she's been very flirty to me specifically but I did not express any interest in her at first due to the age gap. She would find ways to team up with me on projects and we would be together every day at work until all the co-workers just assumed there was something going on between us but neither of us addressed it. \n\nI am starting to like her but don't know what to do. She texts me a lot and we chat on skype, mostly just joking around and flirty shit. I'm pretty sure she has a thing for me from the hints she's dropped but I'm also pretty sure she has a boyfriend but whenever I try to bring it up she changes the subject or vaguely says he's a friend. \n\nA few days ago I saw her randomly with a guy holding hands. She didn't see me and later she texted me asking something and I replied and asked what the did that day. She said something along the lines of \"just hung out with a friend shopping\". Now I'm stuck in a weird situation where I'm not sure what's happening. I'm still having reservations about the age gap so this might be a good thing. Should I not pursue anything? Cut contact? (difficult...we work together and everyone there sorta knows what's happening so they usually team us up anyway) Stay just friends? She doesn't seem to be the type of person who would cheat but then again...I've only known her 4 or 5 months and have been serious friends 2 or 3 months so I wouldn't say I know her TOO well.

How did you know?\nPOST: I'm young and stupid, and I know that there's reason to believe I have no idea what I'm even talking about, but I truely believe that my SO is the one I'll be with for the rest of my life. I was in an abusive relationship with a boy 3 years older than I for the past three years, and my current SO makes me realize how stupid I was to even stay in a situation like that. My ex would verbally and mentally abuse me every day and night, calling me at early hours of the morning because he couldn't sleep, or had a nightmare. He'd yell and scream at me for not helping enough, or for being over bearing. A few times it came to him pushing and choking me. Now, let's just say that those incidents did not roll over well with a southern bell. He was bipolar manic, and never took his multiple medications as he should have. I overlooked too much, and was just willing myself to be ignorant. I cheated. He abused. I cried. He controlled. If we had been a song, we were \"Kim\"- Eminem. Eventually I was numb and lost to the pain I felt. But my current SO showed me everything I was never allowed to believe was real. Our relationship grows each day and every moment, and every time I breathe I just feel like he's the only thing keeping my tried to earth(besides gravity). My ex and I haven't seen each other or spoke since june 5th or 6th of this year. This is the longest I have ever been away from\/without him and I haven't felt the usual need to relapse into him again. My SO keeps me sane, and I feel like he truely saved me. I want to know that out of all the sob stories I hear, and the hurt people I find, that there are people out there who have found their \"One\". I'm asking you all to tell me what you have, what you lack, and what you want. Are they \"the one\"? How do you know? <3\n\nTL;DR:",

The only other person to discuss this with has a *conflict-of-interest* (you'll see why).\n\nMy first 2 relationships were very vanilla. In my third, I met a guy who was insanely attractive and this made me more confident in sex in general. He was interested in anal, I was not. Eventually, he convinced me to overcome my hangups. Just a couple of weeks after we started exploring, he broke up with me.\n\nCue my current bf. Been dating for six months, but technically know him for longer. Comfortable enough to share my history and bring up this fact. Tell him I'm interested. I thought he would be *delighted!* To my shock, he dismisses it. Calls it unnecessary and a \"little too erotic\" in his words. WTF?!!\n\nThen there's the prankster of a friend I know. He's male. NBD. He's gay, so my exes haven't gotten jealous. He buys me this nice metal plug. Partly as a fun prank, partly because he knows I might enjoy it. Again, NBD. I bought him a pair of leather cuffs because I know his major fetish is being handcuffed. We buy each other sexual gifts.\n\nCue my bf again. Hears this. Is absolutely livid. Refuses to talk to me for 24 hrs. Then, remains cold. Says he loves me for everything I've done so far but I'm pushing his limits and apparently making him uncomfortable.\n\nSays he doesn't want anything to do with this and if I respect him I would have nothing to do with it to. Now, I'm pissed. I sorta enjoyed the new sensations and the adrenaline rush of doing something naughty. I started to fantasize sneaking around with it. Surprising my bf. It's not going to fly. I am kinda pissed of. And sad. I also now am starting to think of other instances where he isn't comfortable with how comfortable I am. Me overthinking? Help.\n\nTL;DR:",

Now, with that said, we do have Skype sex (if that's what you call it). This guy *knows* how to get me off and how to finish me by telling me to do the right things. \n\nI knew that I could squirt before I met this person, but damn, I never knew how much. To be as blunt as possible, he told me what fingers to use that could get me to squirt more. So there I was, lying on my bed with my laptop in front of me whilst I was at it, and once I began squirting I seriously could not control the direction of it. At the time I didn't care. It was fucking good. \n\nIt was afterwards that I noticed my fuck up. My laptop screen and whole keyboard was literally soaked. It looked like I spilt a cup of water over it. Instantly I knew it was broken. I cleaned it up so fast but keys began typing letters without being clicked and my screen was going crazy. When I did type, the wrong symbols would appear in relation to what keys I pressed. My friend told me to leave it to dry and it might work but found it hilarious overall. Next time I turned it on, a super loud beeping noise came out of my speakers during the start up screen. Still does this every so often as well.\n\nWeek after, I did it again on my phone screen (you would have thought I learnt my lesson) and now my charging port\/sometimes my volume is fucked. \n\nI'm still suffering to this day. Currently saving for a new computer because my laptop is a piece of shit and enjoys typing crap all the time.\n\nTL;DR:",

I always found his sister attractive but it didn't develop into a full blown crush until last year. She had just graduated high school, and I'm blown away. Not only is she attractive, but she's also extremely smart. So I asked my friend to help me out with her. He said he didn't care, but it seems like out of all our friends, he'd be most comfortable with me dating her. However, all he did was just tell his family and her what I say on a daily basis. Most of it is me busting his chops, like \"I'm going to be your brother-in-law\" or \"Your sister is the most beautiful person in the world\".\nEventually, she found out, and it seemed like she's cool with it. She always says hi and smile whenever we see each other, but lately it's been awkward. Whenever I visit her house, her aunt (who lives there) would whistle whenever I'm around. (Not to be arrogant, but I am pretty fit... and seeing as how I live in California, I'm mostly wearing tank tops and short shorts lol) The mom and sisters would also do that \"wooing\" sound like the kids would do in elementary school. I admit it's nice to know that everyone finds me attractive and they like the idea of me dating her, but she gets embarrassed whenever I'm around and sometimes she ends up going to her room. I have no opportunity to actually talk to her. To make matters worse, she's only there on the weekends because she goes to a college that's an hour away.\nOverall, her entire family is clearly supportive. Her mother and step-father both love me. Her aunt might even have a crush on me tbh (she's in her late twenties). And most importantly, her brother is either pretending to not care, or he is ok with the idea of it. I just have no clue how to ask her out, or even sneak in a conversation with her. To make matters worse (or better?), she's never had a boyfriend. What should I do in this situation? Is this even a good situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

However, I was completely fine not doing anything for those 5 months, then one day we started doing regular teenage things with our bodies. (not sex.) Things progressed from there, and the past couple weeks we've been having great, regular sex, my parents being out of town and her sleeping over at my house while telling her parents she was somewhere else.\n\nWell, today she calls me and tells me that her parents know everything that's been going on. Her dad is very uptight, strict, etc; and he and I were pretty cool before this all happened. One of those intimidating \"you-want-my-daughter-go-through-me\" type of guys, but we hit it off okay. Her mom is also like that, but less so in that she isn't aggressive. (I should also mention her dad was in the hospital for high blood pressure a few weeks ago.) \n\nAnyway, what should I do? Our relationship likely won't ever be the same again, but it was the healthiest I've ever had with a person. Her parents hate me, and I'm going to college in a month or so, is this just the right time to break things off? We've talked and we'd still be friends, of course, but it's pretty rough. Do I continue the relationship and make it hard on her because of her parents? Or should I try to patch things up with them so I can even show my face around their neighborhood? (Unlikely.)\n\nHelp!\n\nTL;DR:",

We have a few close friends each, but we're not party people and spend a lot of time with each other, especially since we've both recently been on summer break (Australia). \nTonight he went out to a bar event with a few of his close friends and since I'm under 18, I couldn't go. \n\nWe hung out before he went there and as soon as I got home after dropping him off I started feeling pretty sad, and kind of jealous (worth mentioning I do have moderate clinical depression). I'm not worried about him doing things with other people, but I just feel jealous that he's not spending time with me. \n\nIt's completely irrational and I can separate myself from it, but I can't help feeling that way and it's infuriating. I've noticed it before when he mentions making friends or times when a girl has given him her number and we've joked about it - I get a little jealous. \n\nI need to learn how to spend more time by myself and not be jealous if he has other friends but I just don't know how.

I thought it was going to be okay but we met up at a pub and we talked about something's and she decided we should spend some time apart.\n\nI know it was kind of my fault I kept saying I would do things but not actually doing them, just things like not managing my money properly, saying I would start driving and I think the main one was that I said quite a few times I would work on my insecurities and that but we would always end up having a talk about it because I made a comment or something.\n\nIt's just really hard and I want to change those things but I want her back so bad, as I said I just haven't been able to do anything these past couple of days, I can't even stand being in my bedroom because of the memories and stuff :\/ any advice would be a great help, even on the length of time I should probably leave it before talking to her again?\n\nTL;DR:",

But is this a wise desire?\nPOST: By my first girlfriend I am talking about my first, longterm relationship (If you can call 40 days long).\n\nBasicly, we broke up because I was an idiot. We dated last year when I was 18 and started socializing for the first time and man.. I was a complete idiot to people. I never had any interaction with a friend group and I found myself as a part of this big cosplay society, I had tons of friends, a nice girlfriend, really cool people to hangout with and then.. I became a real jackass, a real idiot. My girlfriend broke up with me, my friends stopped talking with me and everyone started to hate me, I was talking shit about them for no reason, acting like an idiot. After like 6 months, I improved myself massively, I am friends again with everyone once more, even better than before, I am the guy people talks when they have questions about many things ranging from comics books to science. I am now a better and more civilized person.\n\nAnd now, I want my girlfriend back, I dated a lot of girls after her but never been happy with any of them like I was with my first girlfriend. Now that I am a better person, I think I can have her back. But I don't know if I really want her back. I was happy with her but that doesn't mean I was never sad. She is an artist but not the most talented one, she can't draw very well even though she has art training. But she blamed ME when she couldn't enter an art school, just because I called her at 10 to wish her luck and turns out she went bed early and said \"You woke me up so I couldn't sleep, that's why I failed.\" and that really broke my heart. But in time, she became a better person just like I did. She is hard working, drawing better, doing lots of stuff.\n\nI can win her back I guess, but I am still not sure, I am also planning to study hard and leave this country to live in a better one.\n\nWhat do you suggest? Try my chance or don't even bother for something that already failed?\n\nTL;DR:",

There are two couples- me and my boyfriend, and the host with his girlfriend. There is one fifth wheel.\n\nLast night at around 1 AM, my boyfriend and I were fooling around in our room. Suddenly the fifth wheel barges in, totally unexpectedly, yelling an inside joke and throwing a condom at us, and running away. We were fully clothed, but PISSED. It was incredibly fucked up and we were both shocked. It was obviously the idea of all three of the remaining group.\n\nMy boyfriend and I confronted them, after we both calmed down. We cant understand how they thought this would be funny, as it is so fucked up on so many different levels. We could have been doing anything from sleeping to being naked. What did they expect to see? Did they expect us to just laugh it off? \n\nWhat bothers me most is that the host doesnt seem to be remorseful at all, even though he clearly agreed to this and suggested the idea. He blamed the fifth wheel for everything and said that he doesnt owe us an apology. This shocks me because its completely out of character for him, hes usually very politically correct and gentlemanly. He was a perfect host up till now and we were incredibly grateful for everything hes done for us during the vacation.\n\nAnyways there are 2 days left in the vacation and I dont know what to do right now. Its the morning after so we need to see them soon. Obviously we need to talk as a group, but I really dont know what to do if the host continues his attitude.\n\nTL;DR:",

They have also made a craigslist ad, posting these pictures up, and telling them to contact \"me\" via AIM with the screen name \"ravergirl1991\".\n\nThe craigslist ad has been flagged for removal, so before I was able to see anything that was posted, it was flagged. All the information I know is based off of what the person who messaged me via Facebook had told me. \n\nNow, people I do not know are messaging me nonstop, and some of the messages have been threatening, and now I fear for my safety, even out in public. I have no idea who would do this to me, nor why.\n\nSo all I have now is the Photobucket account whomever made to take my identity and to put me out there.

I texted her a reminder and she said she already ate because she was hungry but that i could meet her at the library to hang out a bit. I feel fed up because many times she has set up a date only to cancel it or change it without seeming to think of me. \n\nI believe she isnt doing it purposefully and is just self focused. Still, i feel like im constantly stressed about our relationship and cant get a good read on what she is feeling. I want to get through to her but when i try to talk about our relarionship i just feel like im spoiling the mood. My question is: should i just accept this as part of her?

It's still over, right?\nPOST: All right, so there's lonely little me who manages to somehow arouse the interest of a pretty girl for awhile. She even kissed me a few times one night. Of course, over the weeks I managed to screw it up by being too afraid to be assertive and she started losing interest in me. She stopped being the first to text and would hardly respond when I texted her. And yes, after the night we kissed all we did was text each other for a week or two because we were probably both waiting for each other to be the one to take things further.\n\nThe people here told me I dropped the ball and it's over. They said she was being too immature to come out and say it's over, probably because she felt she was in too deep because she offered to take my virginity. But then I worked with that girl last night, seeing her for the first time since things went sour. As we left for the night, she gave me a hug, said I can come over with her and a coworker if I changed my mind (even though she never asked to give me a chance to say no in the first place which makes me suspicious), and told me to text her. \n\nHalf an hour later I texted her saying I changed my mind and wanted to come over. She said the coworker (some weird guy 30 years older than us) was mad so she was leaving. Although she still could've been sitting on his couch chatting with him for all I know.\n\nI need you guys to slap some sense into me. Because she hugged me and told me to text her, I have this little misguided sliver of hope. It's still over right, and she's still just too afraid to reject me? What do I do now? Do I text her now? What do I text her? She said she wanted me to text her, but I bet if I text her now I'll be getting one word and effortless responses like before.\n\nTL;DR:",

It feels like a far off utopian ideal. \n\nYet I see places like reddit full of people that at least seem like they care. \n\nIn theory the internet is the ultimate tool for social connection and information exchange. This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. \n\nThis then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).\n\nThe ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). \n\nHowever I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. \n\nHence I ask, \"Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social\/political revolution?\"\n\nWhen I ask this I do not want the opinion of \"people\" or \"society at large\". I am wondering how you personally feel about taking on such an endeavor.\n\nTL;DR:",

I sometimes play with them, too, because I love my boyfriend and he wanted to play with me.\n\nHis friend (not my friend, his friend) called me a bitch today. I was immediately annoyed, muted him, and my boyfriend didn't say a thing. I told him then and there not to let somebody disrespect me like that. He didn't say anything for the rest of the game.

We have been together for 4 months this last Sunday. I have another female friend who I've known for 2+ years who I hang out with fairly frequently. She is straight, but we have no romantic interest in each other whatsoever, and we are both cool with that.\n\nAbout a month and a half ago, my girlfriend approaches me very angry saying how she's upset that I sat next to my friend while watching a movie (even though I was actually sitting in the middle between the both of them). I try and find out why she's upset about this, and apparently she had been holding in her frustration for a while. Before she moved back into town for our college semester to begin, my female friend moved in a week early. Having not seen her for a large amount of the summer, we hung out a lot during the week before school. My girlfriend was not in town for this whole week, and when she arrived that weekend, I got a call that I needed to come home for family reasons. My girlfriend described her anger with this situation as \"You got to hang out with HER for a whole week, and when I got here, you leave me!\"\n\nAfter a while of fighting, I ask her why she's not upset when I spend time with my large amount of other friends (some of which are also female). She said that \"I don't hang around other girls. I don't trust them, all they do is make drama. Girls and guys can't be friends without any romantic interest. I'm tired of girls stealing my boyfriends from me, and I don't want to lose you.\" She now gets upset about me texting my female friend, sitting next to her in any situation, or even bringing her name up in conversation. She's been going through a lot of family problems lately as well, so I don't want to break up with her and shovel even more problems onto her shoulders. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

I am honestly not looking into that at the moment anyway and for a very long time, have not even considered it to be in my future. Regardless, i found myself dating this wonderful guy and I have grown very very fond of him. I am confident in saying that i love him and i know he loves me too. He is a reserved man and relationships have been hard for him in the past, not because he has commitment issues or anything, he could just not connect with the girls he was seeing. \n\nAnywho, we are now together in a healthy relationship and he is going to college in the same city i will be in highschool. I am a junior and plan on applying to a university in the same city. mostly because it is a prestigious university but the fact that he will be nearby is very nice as well.  If i get accepted, i would definitely attend for financial reasons even if it isn't necessarily my first choice. \n\nWe have talked over things vaguely and he says he would really like to stay with me in college. I completely understand if his mind changes and have took tiny steps in preparing myself to let him go should he choose to break up after summer. For now, i guess i'll just go with the time we have together. it's not like he is moving incredibly far anyway.\n\n So reddit, what advice could you give me for the months to come?

Back then, he was very cold to me and we were having a bad time in our friendship. We fell out, because his friends disliked me and I annoyed him or something like that. \n\nNow, he is friends with me again. We are closer. However, the way he's acting with me has changed. He sits more open and talks to me all the time, he does things to get my attention and he stares at me in the eyes while smiling at me. He'll pretend to be cold, but he'll have a little smirk on his face, but not a rude one.\n\nI like this new change. It seems he has forgotten about our argument and my love. People have mentioned it to him, he doesn't say anything. During a conversation with a group about partners and sex, he said to me that \"he might be a tiger in bed\". He's being sweeter, nicer and a little bit...cheeky.\n\nI am getting sick of lying and denying my feelings for him, I just want to tell him, but I'm scared that it will all go bad again.

Our relationship is fantastic, very open and honest. But, around a week ago we were sat talking on the sofa and he took his phone out to show me a photo of his cat. While he was scrolling i noticed a photo of a scantily dressed unidentified female in his camera roll. He clicked on it and was like \"wtf?\" and I was just speechless. Couldn't say anything, didn't know what to say or do. \n\nInstantly he said that he didn't know how that got there and was really confused. He genuinely looked really upset and confused by the situation. I said maybe he accidentally saved it from some website or w\/e. He said that he didn't know and couldn't remember watching or looking at porn of said image. I pretty much shut down and just couldn't say anything else for a while. Eventually he tried to talk to me and apologised for me feeling so shitty and said that it was understandable I was upset. I was very upset, but managed to hold my shit together. We had a talk about it and I pretty much said that I knew he wouldn't do anything like that to me etc.. \n\nAnd to be honest I really can't see him cheating on me and having a picture of her on his phone or anything like that. And it wouldn't bother me if it was just an image from porn. But I can't help but feel upset and uneasy about it. I have a lot of doubt in my head, and I don't know if it's unfounded.

We had moved from another city so this would be her second appt. at this groomer. It had been a year since her last appointment because my family and I decided to groom her ourselves. She was happy and excited when we got there and pee'd a little when the groomer examined her. When we came back to pick her up, the groomer said that was aggressive all throughout and tried to bite her several times. They eventually put a dog muzzle on her. My mom and I were so surprised by this because she has NEVER showed any aggression towards a human or towards any of her previous groomers. In fact, she loves being cuddled by other people and goes to people whenever we're at a dog park. \n\nWhat do you guys think went wrong and what could I do for the next appointment?\nAt first I thought it was because of her matted fur. The groomer shot this theory down and said that my dog was aggressive even after getting the matted hair out.  She has also been a lot more matted before (the very first time when she was a puppy) and had never had aggression issues. Or could it be that she was gone for the groomers for too long and didn't feel comfortable in a relatively new environment with a different groomer? Or could it also be the groomer herself, and that my dog just didn't like her? The previous groomer didn't have any issues. \n\nWhat should I do the next time we go to the groomers? It will be a new groomer again and I hope she doesn't lash out. Will she be able to feel comfortable again? I'm scared that if she becomes too aggressive, no one will take her... :(\n\nTL;DR:",

Need advice?\nPOST: My girlfriend and I have been together for about 9 months, and its been rocky but we managed to work through it.\n\nDue to certain financial things on her end we decided to move in together but broke up and she moved out to stay with a friend. We were under a lot of pressure at the time with both of us losing our jobs at the same time; the companies we worked for went under.\n\n2 weeks ago we got together again and made up. It was great; I missed her and she missed me. We made love for days. She had also gotten work but it was a bit far from where I stayed and she moved in with a guy she met in the classified section looking for a roommate - she said she didn't have much choice and had to move quickly to be close to her new job.\n\nIt's been 3 days since she moved and her entire attitude towards me has changed. At first I couldn't get her off me, now she barley wants to talk to me or see me. She is spending a lot of time with the male roommate and it bothers me a lot, because even thought the guy is rather fat and not good looking at all I can see he fancies my girlfriend and keeps giving her things and is being overly nice. He seems to have some money, but wouldn't call him rich.\n\nHer car broke down and he even lend his other car to her, which is nice but the guy seems like over overly nice if that makes sense. She misses a few of my calls and disappears for hours and feels like she is insinuating she needs her space after we just gotten so close again, just out of nowhere. I tried talking to her about the situation and said how would she have felt if it was me living with a girl and just disappeared and seemed to have a real ball of a time with her and then kinda start ignoring my gf? Needless to say we got into a fight but we both apologized  but essentially the same issue persists. \n\nMaybe I'm just jealous but I'm really uncomfortable with the situation but at the same time that will push her away? So what the hell should I do? I love her.\n\nTL;DR:",

How can I truly get over her?\nPOST: So a year ago on the 28th I met the girl of my dreams. Everything was just fantastic, there was great chemistry, attraction, you name it it was there.\n\nFast forward 2 months (yes I know) I get my ass dumped for \"not showing her I was serious\"... at the same time she she we might be moving fast. I was okay with her wanting to slow down. A kiss each night would have been enough, I didn't need sex. She left me and I've been devastated since. She said she needed time... I was waiting.\n\nI wasn't perfect though, I lied. When we first started talking I implied I had relationship and sexual history, I was tired of being laughed at for being a virgin by choice, yes it happened several times. So I let her think I had experience.\n\nI told her about this after she dumped me. It pissed her off so much and basically got to where she said \"I hate myself for letting you in\". Midsummer this was and then 2 weeks later she has a new bf. I guess she just needed time without me in the picture. That's fine, I messed this up and will have to try and live with that.\n\nMy question, how can I really get over her? I fell hard and fast. I've been living in this personal agony since March. I try and forget her, I try to tell myself if she was my one she wouldn't have let her ex's sins become problems I paid for. What should I do? Anything, everything, I just need to hear any advice. Because I can't figure it out myself.\n\nTL;DR:",

The college I'm attending really fucked up with me, and they realized it. Before this semester my GPA was 3.8 and I had countless extracurricular. A student made some false accusations against me(not rape, actually even worse accusations), and the school punished me before hearing my side or collecting evidence. I just proved my innocence in court the other day, and all records have been expunged and the school was forced to remove disciplinary sanctions against me, but there are permanent damages that have been done. I was approached by a group of lawyers because my case would help make a multimillion dollar class action suit against the school virtually guaranteed, and this was made known to the school. The vice chancellor of my school, as well as many other higher-ups in the administration approached me and said they would bend over backwards to help me in any way they could. I want to transfer at this point because of everything that's happened here, and want them to help me in the process. Does anyone know if this is a possibility? Could the administration here ask another school to accept me as a transfer, or is there no way around waiting till new applications come around and applying for a different school next year? Also, what would you guys recommend I do as far as proceeding with the school. Should I just try catching back up on everything and acting like this never happened, or should I engage the school to have them right the wrongs they did?

Ontario in a small campground where most people knew each other, year after year. As the people of my age group grew older we began camping on our own, in separate parts of the campground from our parents (this would typically be from 19 years old and onward). So naturally, as any people of that age do, we drank (legal age in Canada is 19) and smoked weed and held awesome parties way on the other side of the campground to avoid annoying the other campers. Now my last year of camping at this lake we had a nice party one night lots of people some familiar faces, some new. The next day the administrator of the campground informs my site mates and I that we are banned from the campground for 5 years for giving alcohol to minors. What really happened is irresponsible parents lost track of where their kids were, and also track of where their booze were (the 15 and 16 year olds, who were not invited, obviously stole their parents alcohol). I know I didn't give any alcohol to any of the young people, and I'm sure my friends wouldn't have (we worked our asses off at near minimum wage that summer just to save up enough to go camping, we had no extra drinks.) We appealed the decision, but in a closed door meeting, the board of directors upheld the decision. sigh, it was a good time while it lasted.\n\nTL;DR:",

How to respond?\nPOST: Like the title says, I'm 23. I look my age. I recently decided to get back into tennis since I stopped playing throughout college and wanted to introduce some sort of athletic activity into my life while avoiding my least favorite things in the whole world: getting fat and running. Everyone on my league team is very nice, although I do seem to be the youngest. (Ages range from 27 - 40s.) That's fine and no one has made comments.\n\nThe past couple weeks we've had matches against other teams that seem to consist of older women (40s - 60s). At each of these matches, one of my opponents has, at some point, asked: \"Are you even 18?!\" I don't really understand why they're saying this - to discredit me if me and my partner are winning? - but they're often very persistent. Not persistent enough to question my presence on the team, but enough to make me uncomfortable with their faux-joking. \n\nEven though it makes me uncomfortable in the moment, this isn't hovering over me or haunting my dreams. I just need some suggestions on how to shut this kind of thing down, especially with some quippy one-liner or something. I wrote the first time off but am now 2 for 2 at matches and so want to be prepared for the next time, since I'm assuming there will be one. Last time it happened, I tried to ask if they wanted to see my birth certificate but I don't think they really heard me. Awkward.\n\nTL;DR:",

Last month I went to his buddies [M] house and the three of us were hanging out when their friend [F] showed up crying and upset.  I talked to her about things and we really hit it off, and I was super happy to make a new friend as well as get along with my BF's friends.  I have texted with her and hung out with her, and I genuinely feel she is a real friend.  \n\nThen yesterday my friend since childhood [30F] came over and we were celebrating the end of a string of long shifts at work.  We were pretty drunk.  So my BF and the female friend came over, started drinking too.  My childhood friend asked new female friend if her and my BF went to school together, or how they met, just making drunk meeting new people conversation.  They neither one will say, until finally they admit they used to date.  \n\nMy problem is figuring out how to be grown up about this.

(Location: UK - Wales)\nPOST: What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?\n\nBackground:\nMy employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.\n\nMy problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. \n\nI calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as \u00a3530. I only earn \u00a31,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills\/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.\n\nCan I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?\n\nMy issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).\n\nI think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary.

This time is worse than usual though, since we're both in college in different states.\n\nBasically, this summer we took a class at my school (cheaper for him since his school is out of state) and he stayed at my house (because gas). Class lasts a month. When the class ends, he goes back to school and I pretty much haven't heard from him since. \n\nIts been a month, and I've tried texting him and calling him but he ignores me. He called once to say he was sorry and make excuses (he's \"busy\") and he referenced things I told him in my text messages, so obviously he's reading them, but just not bothering to respond.\n\nI just don't understand what's going on with him. I go from talking to him every day to being completely cut off. I can't just talk to him about it because he'll just ignore me. I don't know if its because he's got a gf now so he doesn't need meanymore, or if we're just doing the whole \"growing apart\" thing way more rapidly than I expected. \n\nI really just want to get some perspective on this, because its really upsetting me.

How to deal?\nPOST: I have a fetish that involves watching an everyday activity. This activity is not remotely sexual for most people and is something they often do socially. It's impossible to avoid entirely. \n\nOccasionally when I'm around family members and they're doing this activity, I'll feel a small bit of arousal coupled with A LOT of anxiety. I find myself wishing I had headphones on so I could look away and ignore the activity altogether - but that would be rude in a social setting and could draw attention to me. I feel panicked, suffocated, trapped and unable to talk out of shame. A couple of times I've quickly made an excuse and fled the room. Other times I've been irritable and rude, unable to focus on anything that's going on. Still other times I've been distracted enough not to be worried by it, or just not bothered by it at all. It's hard to predict when it's going to upset me.\n\nIt's only recently that I've started to feel so panicked about this (I used to deflect it by thinking about my boyfriend doing the activity instead, but he's now an ex and I can't really do that). It's nowhere near OCD level, but I don't want it to get worse. Any advice on how to manage this situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

I decided that I do not want to be the center of attention and would like a couples shower instead of a bridal shower.  Only I phrased it as an engagement party initially.  Now my mother will not listen to anything I tell her after she asks (i.e. she asked if I would like a specific brisket recipe and I said I would prefer my fiancee's family recipe.  She won't let us have his family's recipe).  This compounded with me asking for informal Facebook invitations to a cake and punch (what I originally requested to save mom & dad money) party and them telling me that is not what Brides' (fucking) magazine said to do, I am more stressed out about a fucking engagement party than I am about the actual wedding.  I don't even want the party any more.  Heck, she expected me to hash out a guest list for the party and the wedding WHILE AT WORK. (I go to classes full time and work part time in a position that would easily be full time thus creating more stress)\n\nOn top of all of that is the attire issue.  Mother has purchased two and almost purchased two more dresses.  Only one of the four is in a wedding color not the same as bridesmaids.  I also sent her a picture of a dress I found when just looking to see what was out there.  She refused to comment on it and threw a holy fit over not being there (without asking me if I would show her when she came up in a week).  I ended up buying the dress now because I did not want to deal with it (she would have complained that the underlay is not white).\n\nNow she is saying that because when I invited her up to look at the dress I was not able to go shopping with her that day due to wanting to spend time bonding with bridesmaids, she has been ousted. \n\nI feel that my opinion no longer counts for anything but to decide to do the exact opposite.\n\nWeddit, HELP!!!\n\nTL;DR:",

I told her I did and she started showing me the products on the shelves, grabs one and asks if she should ring it up for me. I gracefully declined as even though I made myself get my hair cut, I still am a broke college student. She wouldn't take no for an answer. She went on about how I am ruining my hair by not using their products and that it is a worthwhile investment. I again reminded her that it is not my lack of desire for the product that stops me, but my lack of money. She continues. We went back and forth for a while until I couldn't stand it anymore, it took me raising my voice and saying, \"MONEY, I don't have it\" before I could leave the tip for my stylist and walk out of there. \n\nSalespeople, do not milk my money udders, they are empty.\n\nTL;DR:",

Now, I do not know how to respond, do I ask why, ask her how come, ask her when... \n\nThing is we have been friends for a few months and I just could not do the friends thing anymore, so I decided cutting contact would be in MY best interests.  I can not ask her on any dates though because she is in Florida till october, and I just need advice on how to approach this situation.  Such as how to handle, stay in contact, be there for her, all the while keeping attraction up to what it was beforehand so that when she comes home our lives can intertwine again.\n\nThanks Reddit,\n\nTL;DR:",

Took me by surprise as I think she is dumber than a box of rocks and I really don't like her and some of things that she has said. I didn't make a big deal out of it because it was last and I was tired. This morning I sent him a text saying that I still couldn't believe he was a Sarah Palin supporter. We went back and forth quite a bit with him not really giving anything solid about why he supports her and me giving examples of why she is bat shit crazy and quoting some of the stupid things that she has said. The last few text where it seemed we weren't getting anywhere:\nHim: It's your opinion, I don't agree with it.\n\nMe: And that's fine we are entitled to our opinions your opinion seems baseless and I thought I would hear something that I may have overlooked or not seen before on this subject but it just shows how some people accept things blindly without really knowing.\n\nHim: I'm fine with that\n\nMe: Yeah that's fine whatever\n\nThat last one was sent an hr ago and no reply back from him. \nI think this may be the end of it but I just think it's silly and wanted to see what others thought.\nThe weird thing is, I don't care about politics and normally don't even get into it with people, I don't really identify with republican or democrat. He has said the same thing that he is neither republican nor democrat but uses the word the \"left\" in a way that he views them as differently than to himself. So I think his views are more to the right. He is the first person that I have ever come across that has defended her. \nSo anyways, is something like this a deal breaker for people?\nI don't think he is going to reply to my text, should I say something to him even though I feel kinda strongly about this?\n\nTL;DR:",

I am in a long distance relationship, eight hours apart.  The college I attend was my first choice for college, though I never had any real reason to want to attend, I just wanted to.  My boyfriend's college is also his first choice.  I was accepted into both.  They are both fantastic colleges, his even being ranked higher than mine.  However, when after talking it over, we decided that me moving away for college, the college I originally wanted to attend would be the best option.  I was to go to his school, and we were to break up, I would feel silly choosing a college over a boy, he would feel guilty for allowing me to make that choice, and overall we would feel awful.  So we decided on doing the long distance thing.\n\nWe have been going out for over three and a half years, and the last year has been difficult.  But we have survived and are even better than before.  Our relationship seems solid.  We do have issues, and they are often exacerbated by the long distance, but we trudge on.  However, through it all, I feel so guilty for putting our relationship through this.  It seems as though this is a relationship that will last, and it would make life ten times easier if we had been in the same school.  He always blames me for the problems we have, because I chose to move away.  I dont really know how to deal with it.  How can I help him move past the decision, and on to fixing the problems that do arise instead of blaming me for my collegiate decision?\n\nSorry for the long post.  It just keeps getting difficult.\n\nTL;DR:",

To preface this I have to start by saying I've been cheated on in the past by 2 different girls one of which I was just shy of getting married to before she came clean...so I'm not the most trusting person in the world anymore.\nI have been seeing this girl for about 3 months now and when I first met her roughly 4.5 months ago she still had a boyfriend. I am aware that this looks like a rebound thing but he was a long distance bf and we've taken things very slow because I wanted to ensure that I was not a rebound. Things have been going smoothly with us and we get along very well. Over the summer she got another job and is moving to a new place (which is closer to her work and to me coincidentally) so she has not had as much free time to spend with me the last few weeks. Here is my problem, she is afraid of commitment especially since she just got out of a 2 year long distance relationship and she does not want to commit to becoming official. Another reason is that she has very little free time lately because of the new job and getting her house ready for the move. I have a growing fear that she doesn't want to commit because she wants to \"shop around\" I have this anxiety even though we have had the exclusive talk.  \n\nSo how do I bridge this gap of where we are in the relationship?\n\nTL;DR:",

This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.\nEvents Leading to the Prank:\nNow, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.\nThe Setup:\nI got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.\nThe Execution:\nYou can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo\n\nTL;DR:",

It's going to be a boy.  My first was a boy.  I didn't want to circumcise him, but I gave in to family pressure.  One of the things I was told was, 'don't worry, everyone does it and everyone is fine.'  Well, after seeing the first emotional expression on my newborn baby's face; fear, pain, confusion... it was traumatizing for me to say the least.  Yes, he's fine now, but that memory will always haunt me.  (And perhaps him too, who knows)  \nSo, now, with boy #2 on the way I am absolutely refusing to put myself and my child through that again!  As you can imagine, I feel I am totally alone in this.  Yes, my husband is standing by me, but he is also being affected by the stress of it.  \nNow, I've been raised Jewish, but I'm not a religious person at all.  I've *always* questioned tradition. I don't keep kosher, I travel on the Sabbath, I don't go to temple, even on the high holidays.  So, I can't justify putting another child through, what I feel is, an out dated traditional ceremony.  It just doesn't feel right.  There is an alternative ceremony that includes the blessings and the bagels ;) but no cutting.  \nOf course there's the issue of both boys being different and if it might cause a problem for my child in the future.  \nSo, my question is, are there any Jewish males out there who have gone through this ceremony and what was it like for you growing up?  Are there any brothers out there who are different in that way and how does it effect your relationship?  \nIf anyone wants to share their story about how they wish they were or weren't circumcised, I'd be interested in hearing it.\n\nTL;DR:",

Upon having a closer look, he pulled out the \"mystery object\" and it was a feather. A small, white feather was lodged inside his chicken!!! Anyways, we talked to the people working there and they literally acted like it was just something that happens everyday. After a complaint,all they did was give us a free new piece of chicken, which nobody honestly felt like eating any more. After complaining to the manager, we got the same result and they didn't seem to care. So what I ask of you, reddit, is what can we do about this? Could it be proof of animal cruelty or something? However, the problem is that we live in Austria, where lawsuits aren't as common as in America, and people generally don't give a shit about these things. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

This kid J- makes some newbie moves during his turn that didn't work out well-- he was attacking my large armies with smaller armies, and he couldn't use all the attack di, so it would be for instance his two attack di versus my two defence di, giving me a significant advantage.  The other kids were teasing him about this, so I said 'He's just using guerilla tactics'.  Everything became quiet.  Someone to my right said 'What?!' The boy looked at me incredulously with some pain in his eyes.  It dawned on me that they had probably understood it as 'gorilla tactics', and thought I was making a racial slur.  I mumbled something about 'yea, guerilla tactics, you know like in Vietnam'... I don't think that clarified the situation at all for these kids.   \n\nSome time later during a church soccer game this boy did a sliding tackle on me that left me sprawled in the dirt.

I'm 5 feet tall and slightly chubby, but still within what is considered a \"healthy\" weight. I've suffered from acne for most of my life and while it's calmed down a bit now, I still have scars and occasional breakouts. I even posted to r\/amiugly and... the results were less than satisfying. I also have anxiety and some minor depression which makes everything 10x worse. However, I'm blessed enough to have a loving and understanding  boyfriend who prefers my body type and makes me feel beautiful.\n\nMy friend is tall, thin, and pretty. She's always been loved by just about everyone she meets, while I've always been shy and quiet and generally forgotten about (seriously, if you asked anyone in my high school, no one knew who I was and everyone knew her). She's perfect model material, so much that she was scouted (during a shift at McDonald's, no less! I hate how the uniform makes me look, but she's model material even at work). Ever since she got scouted, I've felt worse about myself. I always knew I wasn't as pretty as her, but now it was confirmed. I'm the ugly friend. \n\nI've since been... avoiding her. I feel horrible about it, but I can't bear to look at her. The fact that she had this opportunity handed to her on a silver platter because she won the genetic lottery makes me incredibly angry and jealous and sad. The fact that I'll never be beautiful and recognized as such makes me feel worse. The fact that I'm being so petty over this... you get the picture. I don't know what to do about any of it. I can't bring myself to talk to her about it. I'd love any sort of advice.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm his first girlfriend (He's 28 and I'm 19, big age gap I know but we've never seen a problem with it, we both are mature and live on our own, etc) and from what he's told me he's just never known how to talk to girls. His friends have confirmed this. We've been dating for 4 months and he lives 5 minutes from me so we literally see each other almost every day. In the beginning, he always told me how amazing I was and how he was crazy about me. Now, I'm the only one who ever says those kinda of things. I know it isn't a big problem, because he shows he's caring in physical ways by making sure I'm taken care of, cuddling, etc. I stay the night at his place often and whenever I ask, he always says he wants me to stay. We have a great time together, and I always let him know that if he feels like we shouldn't hang out as much, then that's fine. He always seems to want to have me over and to spend time. Sex is great, I just feel like maybe our sexual relationship as developed further than our emotional one. So there's that. I'm sort of a shy person, but not when it comes to my feelings, I really do care for him and am head over heels for him. I let him know that, but for some reason, I expect at this point in our relationship feelings should be talked about more than I just telling him the occassional \"you mean the world to me\" or \"I'm crazy about you\" and him reciprocating it.

I literally only like my ex girlfriend and I'm scared by that. You're free to ridicule me now. Just keep in mind I'm an innocent, sensitive, sweet 15 year old.

The house is in a quiet town, kind of suburb-ish. The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since. She has a collar on but no phone# tag. \n I now have this looming feeling that she ran away because of Caesar. I hate that I'll never know for sure and he'll be moving with me in a few days.\n\nTL;DR:",
    "output_1": "TL;DR: I rescued a feral kitten and named it Caesar. He was quickly domesticated and became sociable with humans and pets. However, his playful nature caused the family's cat to hiss and eventually run away. The family fears that Caesar may have caused the cat to run away, but they cannot be sure. They are worried that the cat may not return before Caesar moves to a new apartment with the person who rescued him.",

I can't even afford to make monthly payments on this, I am still making monthly payments on my own medical shit from years ago, and I save up all year to take my sons in the summer.\n\nIt makes no sense to me that someone could be poor enough to need Medicaid, but a hospital could feel like I could just pay 3000 dollars.\n\nTL;DR:",

This girl was just a friend. Being the immature teenage boy I was, I teased this girl. I remember meeting her and talking to her for a little while at an Interact service (A community service club in my high school). After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like \"You owe me chips,\" as a friendly gesture.\n\nAgain, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like \"You owe me chips!\" and she would say \"No, you owe me chips wtf.\" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.\n\nThe next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.\n\nI walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me. I had no game in high school as you can tell by my previous posts.\n\nTL;DR:",

So I've been dating my current girlfriend since this past August and things have been great. I've actually known her for 3 years but when we tried dating when I was 17 and she was 20, her mom was having none of that so obviously things didn't last very long. So, 3 years later and we're trying again, this time with her mother's approval and her father's approval, or so we thought. Last night my girlfriend's dad gave her a long winded conversation of basically why he doesn't like me, how apparently he thinks I'm not going anywhere in life (to be fair I'm only a student in my 2nd year of Architecture technology, not sure where he got that idea from), he also said I don't talk to him enough when he's never really tried to make conversation with me and says I don't look him in the eye which I have, not sure where that's coming from either, point is he doesn't like me. She mostly thinks it has to due with him being raised by an abusive father, for he kept saying to her well I would never bring a girl to my house when I was your age, which my girlfriend said to me she wouldn't have either if she lived in that house. On a side, my girlfriend has cerebrallypalsy affecting the right side of her brain but its an extremely mild case. The only things she can't really do is drive and cut her own food and other two handed tasks that most people take for granted. So I guess because of this her parents are a little bit more protective. But last night my girlfriend's Father also compared her to her older brother and older sister, saying he never had to deal with any of this from them, (neither of them have any disabilities) so my girlfriend got pretty upset and doesn't know what to do. She wants to move out but her mom won't let  her. I say they shouldn't have it both ways but I'm worried they're going to make her dump me regardless.\n\nTL;DR:",
    "output_1": "TL;DR: Your girlfriend's father doesn't like you because he thinks you're not going anywhere in life and he doesn't think you talk to him enough. He also thinks that your girlfriend's cerebral palsy is the reason for his over-protection towards her. Your girlfriend is upset and wants to move out, but her mother won't let her. Your girlfriend's father compared her to her siblings, which made her feel worse. She is uncertain about what to do and may dump you.",

He does it out of practice since his dad has made him do it since he hit puberty, and naturally it progressed into just being a thing he does every summer. Anyways, if you don't know what Ramadan is, look up some specifics on it but a brief description is that Muslims cannot eat from dawn to dusk for a month long period, as well as other rules such as no touching\/intimacy with loved ones, ingesting water, taking medications, etc. \n\nWithout food or drink, during the blazing hot summer, you'd think someone would get a little moody. Truth. My boyfriend's dad is going nuts. He normally is every other 11 months of the year, but currently, it's some sort of ongoing insecurities with my boyfriend also stepping up in his adulthood by getting his licence, a career and paying bills, all in sequence. I don't know if that has something to do with it but I believe it does, as he is the eldest (by over 10 years) and his dad has some cultural expectations for him, as well as threats of throwing him out of the house, not doing enough for his mom, and so forth. To say in the least, it's very hard to witness and hear about. \n\nSo I'm writing this asking any other Redditors if you have every had a SO with a personal choice or a parents' influence to do Ramadan, and how you (as a non-participator) felt\/dealt with it? \n\nAlso, how can I stop feeling distaste towards his dad, as I see this  packing on more and more emotional weight on my SO?\n\nTL;DR:",

Had to wait 1 month just to be told they had no job for me. 2 weeks later, I go to mcdonalds interview and didn't get it because it was an on-call job. Next up is kmart interview. I'm  guessing I didn't get it becuase I was quiet durimg the interview. Then I said fuck it, going to apply to pizza hut again. I get the call, go to the interview, and they tell me to go today at 11 a.m. I thought \"fuck yes, finally a job!.\" But that's not the case. My parents are telling me not to take it because it's a \"dangerous\" job. My dad and I basically got into an argument for the first time today becuase they didn't want me to get that job. He said if I don't take it, he'll give me $100 a month (yeah cause that's a lot for a 19 year old..) He says to not take get the job for my mom. My mom gets nervous easily and shes scared that I'll get in a crash or I'll get assaulted or something. It doesn't help that i got into a car crash on October or that my aunt and uncles baby died on sunday. I'm guessing the babies death got her scared of something happening to me.

Decided to take a warm relaxing shower. So since my drunk ass can barely stand I sit down and enter this meditation type state. When I do this meditation like thing I stay awake but I cant hear anything and I pay no attention to literally anything. So finally I decide to get out of the shower and my roommate is there yelling at me that I flooded the room. I go out and I realize that my drunk ass was on the drain so there was water about a cm high on our floor. So I had to for about 30 mins use all my towels and clothes to try to soak up the water. Now it has been 12 hours and our floor is still damp, and because I used my all my clothes and towels to clean it up I have been doing so much laundry today to clean all the dirty clothes I have created. I have used probably about 15 bucks on laundry today FML.\n\nTL;DR:",

Spent 30 minutes cleaning up the water and has been doing laundry to clean up the dirty clothes.\nPlease note that this is a fictional post and it's not real, it's just for educational purposes.\nIt's important to note that getting drunk and doing something dangerous or reckless is not a good idea, as it can lead to negative consequences. It's also not recommended to use towels and clothes to clean up water as it can cause more damage and it's not efficient. It's best to use a mop or a bucket to clean up the water.",

I ask him that too and his response is he doesn't miss anyone it's not just me but in the beginning he used to tell me he missed me...\n\nShould I just end things or are there ways to maybe fix it? I mean he says he doesn't want to break up but like it's unfair to me how unavailable he always is! \n\nAnd it's not like he's doing something important he just would rather be with his friends over me.  Idk maybe it's me! Maybe I'm super lame or something!  I can't say he's keeping me around just to get laid bc we don't alway have sex when we do hang out? \n\nI guess he lost affection towards me bc I can be a little paranoid and I accuse him of cheating on me when he is away but only because he's unaffectionate so when you think someone's not into you your brain will take you places!\n\nTL;DR:",

I am beside myself with rage and want to intercept her before he can get to her. This could cause legal issues. What do I do?\nPOST: Quick back ground, I was only with my daughter's father for a very short time. He was in the military and got moved away when she was about 2. I thought he was  decent guy and was involved as much as he could be and always paid support, gave gifts and saw her whenever he could. \n\nHe recently moved back into our city with the military and my daughter has been so excited. I am not happy with all the changes because I don't think he feeds her well, he wants her to play sports (both my girls are very arts and computer orientated). So far she has taken to all of this stuff because he's very handsome, charismatic and was a pro football player for two years. She is over the moon in love with him, which I don't want to stop even if I have issues with it. \n\nHe just texted me that he was going to take her to a fucking gun range after school. I said absolutely not. It's not safe and I do not believe in guns in any way shape or form and they should be banned and every gun owner should be arrested and locked away for life (yes I feel that strong). He said that he does have custodial rights and that as long as its legal, he can do what he wants. I said absolutely not. He said we could talk about it in person when they got to my house. \n\nI want to stave this off and go grab my daughter out of school right now and get a restraining order against him. This is sickening. I'm a momma bear and no one fucks with my kids like this. \n\nWe have an agreement (not legal, but written and signed) that he gets to pick her up from school on the days I'm in class. But from what I understand it could be used me in court and I guess technically what he is doing is not illegal (but it is grossly immoral in my opinion) \n\nCan anyone offer advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

(If you think you know where this is going, you are absolutely right.) For some reason, we thought it would be a great idea to try that, only we couldn't find a penny, so we decided to try to flatten a dime. Shockingly, dimes and pennies are made of different materials, so we weren't making much progress, but like good little elementary school kids, we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house. When it was my friend's turn, I noticed Roosevelt's face was angled about 40 degrees away from her, and for some reason it seemed really crucial that he be facing her dead on, so I rotated the dime. I was a neurotic, whiny kid, so when my mom heard me crying, she assumed it was something minor and came out rolling her eyes before she saw all the blood. Luckily, I didn't break any bones, but I had a cool hangnail with which to gross out all the boys on the bus for the next few weeks.\n\nTL;DR:",

Is video games really killing my intelligence?\nPOST: When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again.

I was low on groceries from moving and bought a ton of food to last me a couple of weeks. I figured I might as well by some potatoes because they're easy to make even though I rarely ate them growing up. After a few weeks, I was settled in but had yet to eat the potatoes that were sitting on the bottom of the shelf I put all my food on. They had started budding a bit and I decided that I should let them bud a bit more since I had never seen them grow more than the few little spots\/eyes. So, after another month, they had budded a lot more to a point where they were piercing through the packaging. I thought this looked pretty cool and once again decided to keep them there to see how far they could go before I got bored of them, or when they started taking up too much space. Now, after a couple more months, I stopped checking on them and pretty much forgot they were even there. This was only until recently when I was throwing out any old food left on my shelves... Before this, there were a lot of bugs (I'm told fruit flies) in my house, but I guessed they were coming through my window from the creek nearby... However, when I was throwing out the old food, I noticed the potatoes had grown massively, and I could see they were falling apart when I picked them up. That's when I realized where the insects were coming from. Inside the packaging were dozens and dozens of larvae eating the potatoes. I immediately dropped the package in disgust and had chills running through my body. I picked it up after a few seconds of shouting \"HOLY SHIT\" over and over, and threw it away in the dumpster outside immediately... Now I'm just hoping the flies were only coming from the potatoes and not anything else I have neglected throwing away...\n\nTL;DR:",

Please help.\nPOST: We split up in the middle of the summer because she was leaving for the semester, and she wasn't into me anymore (or so she claimed). We got back together at the end of the summer temporarily when our families stayed at the same hotel for a week during vacation.\n\nShe left for the semester, started hooking up with a douche who eventually cheated on her and got expelled. I made a terrible decision and hooked up with one of her friends and had a brief fling with another one. I was incredibly depressed and looking for someone to cling to for support. She had a brief fling with another guy and is currently pursuing a third. We talk a lot over email and chat, although it's mostly me who initiates contact. Towards the beginning of the semester I asked several times if she wanted to get back together and she said it was too early to tell. The last time, I pressed her for an answer (was a month or two ago), and she rejected me pretty brutally.\n\nShe came back for thanksgiving break and didn't particularly want to see me, although she wasn't totally opposed to it. She went to a random party and hooked up with several guys but apparently they weren't particularly desirable. She posted a bunch of shit on her tumblr about lost love and missing someone. She could mean me, or could mean the guy she's currently pursuing. I have no idea. She posted a picture with the caption: \"You used to be alright. What happened?\" and said \"[name], lovie, this is for you.\"\n\nThose are the facts and I have no idea what to make of them. I think she still has feelings for me, but is also angry\/disgusted with my hooking up with her friends. I've apologized and explained myself to her, and I don't know how best to help the situation now.\n\nI would really like to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know if that's possible or how best to go about doing that. My idea was to give her some space for a month (aka no contact) and seeing how she feels when she gets back. Am I an idiot? What should I be doing? I have no idea what to do. Please please help.\n\nTL;DR:",

I can never seem to pinpoint a cause or even a correlation. It just comes and goes randomly. They're very brief smells, but they can be very strong.\n\nI got it checked out by a GP in November last year, who then recommended I go see an ENT. ENT isn't free until January.\n\nFast forward to January, I see the ENT. He checks my ears, nose, and throat. He cleaned my ears, and stuck a thing (don't know what it's called) up my nostrils to check for tumors in the nasal passage. Everything was clear, and he figures it might be a damaged nerve. He said that it might fix itself in time. Which didn't make sense to me since the smells have gotten more frequent and stronger, yet still random.\n\nTells me to get a CT scan done just to be sure there are no tumors. Got the CT scan done, fast forward a week or so, got a call from the ENT and says that it's all clear. No tumors.\n\nNo tumors is great, but surely there's a definitive answer as to what is causing these phantom smells, right?\n\nI've read up about migraine auras and how they usually come before a migraine, but I ruled that out since I don't get migraines after the smell happens.\n\nTL;DR:",

The position is right, the pay is right, and the work\/life balance looks to be promising. They sent over a formal offer for me to look at, in addition to an additional agreement that needs signed with a non-compete agreement. I completely understand the need for such an agreement, as the company will be extensively investing their time and resources in training me for the job. They are also one of the few companies that hire in individuals with no experience, so any and all skills I will develop that ae industry specific over the next few months will be thanks to them. While I definitely have no plans to leave the company any time in the near future, the language of the agreement concerns me. The list of jobs that the agreement states will be in breach of the non-compete is way more broad than I feel it should be. It basically limits me from doing any type of research position at any level, regardless of its relation to my actual position I will be taking on. As someone with a science degree, basically all jobs I would be qualified in pursuing in the event of my leaving\/termination would be off limits for a year after my last day of employment. The language used in the agreement is very open-ended and broad, and I hesitate to put myself in that position in case something doesn't work. Has anyone else had to sign such a broad non-compete, or has anyone successfully negotiated the terms of a similar agreement? I really want to accept this job, and again I reiterate I have no intentions in leaving the company any time soon. I just don't want to put myself in an impossible situation should I be forced to leave somewhere down the road.`\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I get to know him now?\nPOST: I've started sleeping with this amazing guy and our sexual chemistry is out of this world, mind blowing good. For reasons unbeknownst to me we are incredibly comfortable and intimate and loving in the bedroom. We both recognise that it's like we've skipped 6 months ahead sexually though we've only been seeing each other 2 weeks. \n\nIm concerned about the massive imbalance now that we've agreed to date and be exclusive. We know each other so intimately in one way, but out of the bedroom we are essentially still acquaintances. The chemistry doesn't really match up so I feel a little awkward working backwards and getting to know him on a personal level, it's a little hard to look him in the eye outside the bedroom.\n\nWe have yet to go on a date or see a movie\/tv show the whole way through. It's essentially been a 2 week bang fest. I know a solution would be to force these getting-to-know-you dates, but now it feels stupid and awkward to try and force conversation after things have been so effortless otherwise.\n\nWe get a long and laugh a lot, but always in the bedroom alone. It got really weird and uncertain when we were out together socialising with mutual friends once. I hated it. Now avoiding those scenarios massively, but it's self defeating to what I want. \n\nWill it even out? How can I get to know him quickly and comfortably? I'm so damn awkward I can't stand it.

It was a diabetes benefit game that had rides and games set up out in an open area by left field, which included a bouncey-house thing and an enormous inflatable water slide contraption. At around half time, me and my dickhead friends decided it would be hilarious if we unplugged the bouncey-house while nobody was looking.  Nobody was remotely near it so we figured it would just a quick laugh and nothing dangerous.  My friend J pulled the plug out from a power strip on the ground, and we waited for about 5 minutes for something to happen, but nothing did.  We were just turning to get back to our seats when literally hundreds of parents started screaming and running to the giant waterslide behind us.  It had tipped over on its side and about 30 small children were clinging to the side as it deflated on top of them.  Terrified, we fled the stadium and sat outside.  A firetruck and 2 police cars showed up, so we ran and hid in the woods behind the parking lot.  An hour later, we returned to the stadium and learned that everyone was okay.  I laughed for so long and so hard that I was sore for days after.\n\nTL;DR:",

What are some good banks?\nPOST: So over the past two years I've been lucky enough to save about 20k.  I've got it all in my checking account right now. I'd like to move most of that money into a savings account to be sort of an emergency fund and move about 4-5k into a checking account for my bills and everyday expenses.  Then, once I have the two accounts I can tailor my direct deposit paycheck to put the amount I'd like to save each month into my savings account and the rest will go into my checking.  Does this sound like a good idea?\n\nI'd like this new checking account to be somewhere that doesn't charge me any fees.  Right now I get docked 2 bucks at most ATM's and get a 5 dollar monthly fee...\n\n**Some other questions and facts about my self:**\n\nI've got 825 shares in MTW stock that I'd like to sell and put that money else where, but that's a whole other question and thread.  This is worth about 13k right now.  I'm also going to need to buy a new car here pretty soon.\n\nI'm young and have been lucky enough to save quite a bit of money.  I don't know a lot about personal fiance so far though.  Would it be a good idea to go to some sort of financial adviser to help me better plan out how to save my money?\n\nTL;DR:",

Backstory: I'm on a trip with my parents and dog and to my disapproval, I have to share a room with them. Two beds, in an exceptionally small room but hey, there's a kitchen. In all fairness though, a room just for me or even for my dog too would be a lot of money, but I digress. This literally happened about 15 mins ago, when I was just browsing the front page. Now, I wanted to keep it clean bc I don't need to be a horned up 18 year old in the same room as his parents. But, gonewild got the better of me. After a few posts, shit, I started to feel some type of way so I decided to check out that site Reddit is advertising, Thumbzilla (not bad). I found a video and as things started to get heated in it, my hand slipped under the sheets and there was rubbin' galore. This went on for about 5-7 mins before I looked past my laptop screen and saw the glint of my mom's eyes staring me dead. In. The. Face. Instantly, I froze, pretended nothing happened, closed the laptop, and rolled over in the bed. Might as well have been my grave. She hasn't said anything to me and I doubt she will but I don't think she can unsee what she done seen.\n\nTL;DR:",

His mother is a complete irresponsible mother (she's lost 2 children to the state), and my boyfriend has never had a relationship with them. She works long hours as a nurse a few hours away from her home, so she is often not at the house. My boyfriends brother is at the house, but all he does is sit around in his basement playing video games, not paying attention to his surroundings. Now, the dog that they have is a rescue dog. They adopted him a couple years ago. I've seen the state of the house when my boyfriend used to live there, and it's terrible. There is dirty laundry all over the place, dirty dishes throughout the kitchen, open paint cans laying around, and so many other terrible things. That dog craps all over the place because I believe he needs to be let outside but no one is paying the right attention to him. When he is outside, he's often tied up on a line in a muddy driveway and will often escape. The brother screams at him when he barks (probably barking because he needs attention), and the mother is never around to look after him. Overall, I'm wondering if I should make the anonymous phone call to Animal Control, and if they will actually do something about the situation. I don't think anyone hits the dog, but I don't even know how much he is fed (or if he is even fed enough). Is this enough for the dog to be taken to a better place??\n\nTL;DR:",

We get along great, and I really enjoy her company, but I just don't want to settle down at such a young age, especially in NYC. She also expressed doubts that I was in it for the long haul, and has expressed that she wants to move away from the city, but that I was her anchor. Hopefully now she can make a decision that's not based on whether I go with her or not.\n\nIt sucks because I still love her so much, just not in the way she wants me to. She is the nicest person on the planet and her reaction to me breaking it off was heart-wrenching. I could tell this hit her out of the blue, and all she kept saying was she hoped this was a nightmare that she could just wake up from.

Yesterday our parents sat the three oldest of us down and told us they had filed for divorce. I'm not really bothered by it since I saw it coming. My real problem is I don't want to go anywhere my siblings go.\n\n>I don't have a good relationship with my family. My mum and dad >haven't gotten along for years and have always taken their frustration out on me. They didn't want to parent us and wanted me to step up and take care of my siblings.\n\n>My siblings and I hate each other. My brother thinks its funny to wreck my stuff and steal my savings (summer jobs). My sister steals my stuff and is physically abusive (hits and scratches me). If I retaliate I get slapped and if I try to take my stuff back I get yelled at because \"I'm the older sibling and should be the bigger person\".

I wouldn't mind going to foster homes if it comes to that, I reckon it'll be better than having those two constantly ruin my days. I don't really want to meet them either if my non-custodial parent gets visiting rights.\n\n>I don't know if I'll get asked for my preference when my custody is decided. I talked to me school counselor and she said she didn't know much about it (haven't had any kid come to her with that problem) but said she'd expect the judge to get that sorted.

[VA]\nPOST: I'm not sure if this is the right community for this, so please point me to a better place if one exists.\n\nI got laid off about a month ago and started freelancing via Elance. My second day, I got offered a regular freelancing gig writing 500-word articles at a good pay rate. I took it on, and because I was so new, I didn't know about or use the time tracking tools Elance has built in to guarantee payment. I know, stupid of me, but so it goes. Over two weeks I wrote about 30 articles for him.\n\nSo I turned in my invoice and, surprise, I never got paid. Elance said since I hadn't used their time tracking tools, all they could do was give me contact information. I tried and got nothing -- no surprise, since all they had was an email address and a fake phone number. So that was a dead end.\n\nBut I was able to identify and reach some of the webmasters who had originally commissioned the articles, and one told me he'd bought it from someone on Fiverr. I talked to the Fiverr person and she said she'd outsourced it to a friend (uh huh) and had no idea it was stolen. She refused to tell me who she'd outsourced it to. I suspect she probably resold most, if not all, of my stolen work. Unfortunately, Fiverr doesn't seem to have a way to see what jobs someone has done, so that seems to be another dead end.\n\nI guess my question is, is there any point in reporting to Fiverr? Are there other legal steps I could take? Or do I just need to move on and eat the losses?\n\nI'm in Virginia. The person who hired me claims to be in California but who knows if that's true.\n\nTL;DR:",

Is she taking her friends words too seriously?\nPOST: Alright, so my girlfriend of 4 months, it's nothing super serious as of yet, but we're really close and she's perfect, laid-back, doesn't complain when I hang out with my friends and don't talk to her for a couple of hours but, last night she sent me a weird message and I wasn't sure how to take it.\n\nThe message read \"Do you feel like you dating someone in highschool whilst you're in uni is going to hold you back from anything?\" (I asked her what the anything was and she put emphasis on girls, and just things in general).\n\nI gave her a long response about how I really feel and in a nutshell she would never hold me back from doing something, and if I thought about being with other girls, I shouldn't be in a relationship.\n\nShe responded basically with just \"Glad I won't be keeping you from anything\" and she thought she was the reason my friends and I had a little argument last month, but she had nothing to do with it.\n\nI personally feel maybe it was an underlying attempt to get me to think about our relationship, a lot of people have mentioned our age difference which is about 1.5 years and to me that's nothing really, my Nanna and Grandad met when they were 18 and 15, but times do change. And I feel she maybe has taken what people have said about the small gap really hard, but she's never mentioned it until now.\n\nIt's only a small time of dating, I'm her first boyfriend and maybe she doesn't know what to expect, I've tried to like, be understanding if she's feeling awkward in certain situations to help. \n\nI'm unsure of what her message meant if anything, did she really just want me to think about that or did she want me to re-evaluate my choice of dating her rather than going for new girls at university, but I have no interest in them and I haven't even thought about leaving her to explore other options in my new environment.\n\nTL;DR:",

Two weeks ago though I learned my mother is moving to another town (we'll call it Town X) about 1.5hours away and has said I can come live with her. Now, I'm absolutely going because I've wanted to live in Town X for a long time and I'm not going to give up this opportunity. I talked with my boyfriend and he said he understands and still wants to try making the relationship work and so do I. However in Town X I have a friend (let's call him John) who I have a slight crush on. I met John while he was visiting in my town shortly after becoming official with my bf. Physically  John is exactly my type, and he's very intelligent with a great sense of humor (we bonded over Reddit funny enough). Because I'm attracted to John I made sure the few times we've hung out it's been in a group and I haven't put myself in any situations that could lead to something (like drinking with him). My attitude about it up until now has been \"Oh well. Crushes happen, but I have a boyfriend.\" Since I told John I'll be moving up to Town X, we've been talking a lot more though. I also learned where I'm moving to will be 10-15minutes away from where he lives. He's also the only person I know up in Town X, and we'll probably be going to the same school in the Spring, so I feel like we're going to spend a lot of time together. A mutual friend told me John has a crush on me as well and would honestly prefer us to be a couple instead of the guy I'm with now. I like my boyfriend very much and I think he's the nicest guy I've ever been with, but I feel like the world's building up circumstances to push me and John into something in a weird sort of way. I'm going to try my best to keep things going with my bf, and I believe communication is key, so should I try to talk to my bf about John? If so, what should I say?\n\nTL;DR:",

The offices, seemingly in plain clothes approached my car and without hesitation shouted at me asking why i was going so fast. I replied saying my car was in neutral and i was gling downhill but i surely wasnt going more that maybe 5 over if anything at all. He replied to me \"No not here back there at the light where you turned left!\" I was confused to say the least and he ripped the license and registration from my hand and went back to his car only to return with a ~$250 ticket for speeding which he basically threw at me before storming off. The ticket stated that i was \"Clocked\" and \"Estimated\" going 57 in a 40 which i definitley was not. I could not have come from 0 mph to 57 mph before taking that left turn in the 1999 car that i drive, not even on a good day could most standard cars do that nor would I do that with a passenger in my car on a major road.\n\nTL;DR:",

A long time ago in Jr. Highschool I had this teacher, we'll call her Mrs. R. Mrs. R was just genuinely unlikeable as ar as teachers go. She had bad breath, treated us all like we were 5, took her class way to seriously, and never gave students second chances on anything. So one day I decided it would be funny to rip a massive fart in the middle of her trying to teach the class something. I went over it with my buddies and they all thought it would be hilarious. Thus, Operation Massive Rip was born.\n\nSo basically, Op: MR went something like this. She was in the middle of discussing plot structure or something and I had finally built up enough pressure to let one rip. I let out the loudest earth shaking fart the world had ever seen. My friends in the class started laughing hysterically which led to everyone else laughing. Mrs. R, the bad breath smelling party pooper she was,  got red faced and decided to kick me out of the class. She then sent me to another teacher's classroom where I had to copy 4-5 sentences saying bodily functions are inappropriate in the classroom 100 times. To this day, I have never seen a crazier reason to be kicked out of a classroom.\n\nSo Reddit, what's the craziest reason you've ever seen someone be sent out of the classroom?\n\nTL;DR:",

Would it perhaps be more reasonable in terms of the amount of taxes I will have to pay for me to \"Purchase\" the vehicle from my father for the low low price of $10? Would this avoid the gift tax?

What would you do if you were me?\nPOST: I graduated college last August and got a job working in Charlotte. I moved up there with my girlfriend of 2 years, who had also recently graduated and gotten a job there. Fast forward to a month ago. The COO of my company calls me in on a Friday and tells me that they were going to move me to a different department. I didnt really want to leave my current position, so I told him I would take the weekend to think it over.\n\nLater that night, i was exhausted and fell asleep early. I woke up to loud noises in the kitchen. So i walked in there and found my gf packing her shit up in a bag. She had gone through my phone and saw a text convo to a friend of mine about how I had been having doubts as we moved toward marriage (due to religious differences). Blah blah blah...we broke up. 100% over.\n\nWith me and her being over and me \"losing\" my job, there was nothing for me in Charlotte. So i went in on Monday and put in my two weeks at my job. I got out of my apartment in Charlotte and moved back to my mom's house. \n\nI have $7,000 in savings. 2 credit cards with no balances. ~$11500 in student loans (payments currently deferred). I dont really have any expenses besides gas right now. \n\n**I want to start a new life.**\n\nI have considered getting certified to teach english abroad for a year or two (i would probably wind up in asia). After that, I would apply to the peace corps. This has always been a dream of mine. But i dont know if its realistic.\n\nIf not that, I would like to at least move to a new city and find a new line of work. Preferably somewhere out west or in colorado.

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk\/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?\n\nTL;DR:",

MAA is slowly posting the high scorers(with the scores) for the AMC 8 on their website. They seem to post school by school. My mother got extremely angry when she saw that they posted a score from someone in my, but didn't post my score. (The highest score you can get is a 25, they were posting any score that 19 or above) She has been screaming at me for the last hour about the whole deal. As a middle schooler taking Precalc, my mother and I were expecting me to score 23 or higher. However, according to the website, I am not a high scorer. This will not daunt me, I will do try to get a great score for the AMC 10. This post was relieve some stress. Thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR:",

Yoga and sexy boots - all in the same day :)\nPOST: I've been wanting to post one of these for so long since it's been a while since I could say I've had a significant SV.  Yesterday I went to a yoga class for the first time in about 3 years and it was great.  I felt strong and honestly I didn't feel like I looked that bad either.  Not great, but not bad.  I wasn't hating myself during the class so that's at least something.  Then by the evening I felt like crap about myself again.  The negative thinking started in and I was telling myself that going to yoga didn't really matter because it wasn't a very hard class and that there was really no point in my trying to look better because I was always going to be fat and ugly.  \n\nIn spite of all the bad things I was telling myself last night I decided to go to another yoga class again this morning.  This time it was a hard class.  I struggled through some of the more difficult poses but I still did it and while I certainly wasn't the best in the class, I wasn't struggling the most either.  \n\nThen after the class, because I was feeling pretty good about myself, I decided to go shopping.  While at the store I tried on a pair of knee high leather boots.  AND THEY FIT!  This may not sound like a big deal but in the past when I wanted to buy a pair of tall boots, I couldn't find any that were wide enough in the calf for me.  Believe it or not, this was the first time since just after high school when I was skinny and underweight that I've been able to put on a pair of boots like that.  Unfortunately I couldn't buy them because they were too expensive but who cares, the point is that my fat legs were not the reason I couldn't have them.\n\nTL;DR:",

Didn't really think to much of it and said that we could talk about it when the time came. In my head I was thinking DOWN the road like 2-3 years in. \n\nFast forward to saturday night when we are hanging out in her room and she brings it up again, only this time she says that it needs to happen soon. She explained that she LOVES sex and she is in love with me (the feelings are mutual) but that I cannot fully satisfy her sexually and she sometimes needs to go out and have sex with another guy\/girl. She also explained that the way she views sex is that it is purely physical and that no physical attraction would get in the way of our relationship.\n\nI am honestly torn up about this... The idea of going out and being able to sleep with other people honestly is appealing, but at the same time I have never ever been in love and I feel like my heart can be broken easily as well as my ego getting in the way. I really want to be okay with this but I am having trouble with the whole idea. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

My parents have affirmed that to me many times. And about two years ago I started to think and realize that I don't really want to be in the church, but I didn't want to tell anyone because I didn't want to disrespect anyone. Then a few months ago, I finally couldn't take it anymore, I started to get annoyed by what many people were telling me in my three hour long meetings. I just overall wasn't very happy.\n\nSo naturally I faked being sick the next Sunday, didn't go to church and had no association to religion for the next two weeks (you can't be sick just one week). It was the happiest I'd been in a long time, no worries about a god that I didn't believe in watching my every move. \n\nThen another Sunday came, I knew my parents would start to get on me after three weeks of \"sickness\" so I decided to come out and tell them that I didn't want to be a part of their church anymore. It was one of the hardest things I've had to do, My dad was not pleased with this. He just assumed that society broke me and I had been spending too much time out in the world, so he grounded me, but not only that he restricted my every move. So this has led me into depression and It's soo hard to leave the house now, but it's also the only way I can come close to being happy.\n\nTL;DR:",

I don't feel satisfied as much and want things to change, but she doesn't know this and I'm afraid to speak up.\nPOST: So me and my girlfriend have been together for 2 years. We don't live together or see each other as often as we'd like (distance) but we are very committed. At first we were exploring and experimenting sexually, but it soon faded away and we are now very set in our ways.\n\nIt was going to be a wall of text so I've narrowed it down to this. These are my problems:\n\n* We only do one position now, which is her favourite.\n* I want to experiment with more positions and other things.\n* I asked her what she likes during sex, she seems to have no specific turn-ons or anything she'd like to try. She's happy the way things are.\n* I however do have some things, nothing crazy. (Braided hair, a fave position, her wearing boots)\n* I'm afraid to own up and be open about these things, because she is easily offended. (Once got upset that I said I preferred a different position)\n* She is quite prudish, and may think even these simple things are weird.\n* I don't know how to be open with her. On one hand I'm worried she'll get angry that I haven't opened up earlier or will think I'm unsatisfied (sort of true), and will flip out.\n* On the other hand, if I don't say anything nothing will change and will get worse for me, but she is already happy.\n* I am perfectly happy to do things that will please her too. I don't want to be selfish about it.\n\nI just want us to be open with each other and try new things,  *without* her getting angry about it. What can a guy do?\n\nTL;DR:",

Can you help me out by clicking vote?\nPOST: A newspaper (Metro News) is having a contest and effectively whoever gets the most votes can win a chance at a sub-orbital flight into space. Judges will be polling the applications with the most votes, so you really can help me win a trip to space! Because of what region I'm applying in, there is very little competition.\n\nMy entire life I've been working towards a career in space science. I spent years working at one of Canada's only dedicated Space Science and Human Space Flight museums teaching about the wonders of the cosmos. I do research in astrophysics now: I work on the VERITAS experiment, a gamma-ray observatory near Tucson, Arizona. I am participating in Mars simulations (I am the Chief Engineer for the Mars Desert Research Station's Crew 116) and in my free time I like reading and learning about the history of human space flight. My passion for this field allows me to do public outreach with the Astrophysics group at McGill University. I love being able to share my passion with others and get them interested and motivated in such a fantastic field. Being able to go on this adventure would be achieving a life goal.\n\nThe current post with the most votes has ~25,000 votes. This is nothing compared to some of the other regions (which have 60,000+). So, really, support from even a small part of Reddit can really help me out. I'm in second place with just under 2800 votes.\n\nAll you need to do is go to  and click 'voter' (French for 'vote'). **No signup, nothing. Just vote.** Use your phone, your laptop, your tablet, anything!\n\nAnything you do will *really* increase my chances of going on this adventure. The contest runs until the end of the month. It's one vote per computer, per day.\n\nThis would be a life accomplishment for me. Reddit, please help me! (If anything, please upvote this so that it gets more visibility! This is a self post so karma wouldn't be an issue).\n\nIf selected, I promise to do an AMA.\n\nTL;DR:",

If you were me, what would you do?\nPOST: Basically, I've had to get an AVO (Apprehended Violence Order) against my downstairs neighbour. We live in a really old building with little to no insulation, so noise travels *really* easily. \n\nBut he takes offense to the smallest things at really random times (11am, Sunday morning, being on the phone with my Dad and wandering around the apartment was cause for a 7 minute tirade in the stairwell about how I'm a dumb white cunt who's always walking around. I don't know if he expects me to teleport or hover between rooms, but unfortunately, I can't do either.\n\nHe's threatened me a couple of times (raised fist, prevented me from exiting the building, tried to kick down my apartment door the other day) the last time he did it, I'd been watching TV with a few friends (normal volume) - no-one else has ever witnessed these events before and they encouraged me to call the police. Police suggested I get an AVO, and so I did.\n\nNext day, I call the real estate and say basically, okay, look. I need to leave or this guy does, because I am terrified of him, and this seems to be escalating. They decide to evict him (he's being served papers today) but with 90 days notice, I'm basically going to have to live with an enraged junkie for three months.\n\nSo, I'm not sure what I can do to either protect myself, should I just move out and bear the cost of breaking lease five months early.. Do I get a new giant bro housemate, because my current one has basically fucked off to her friends house and left me to deal with the whole mess... or do you guys have another idea?\n\nTL;DR:",

At the first two bars my friends keep telling me about how they were going to wing man for me and it all worked out great up until the third bar. We are touching and dancing and things are going great till I feel the need to step outside for some air. By the time I come back the two friends who were wing manning for me, were wing manning each other. A few friends and the girl i like decide to come back home to my place and have some drinks and chill. As a gesture I lay out a bed roll for my friends to lean on and this is where it all goes down hill. Keep in mind that i sleep on a Japanese style floor mattress. A mix of tired and drunk kicks in to where I am just drained from the amount of social interaction to the point where I'm barely in the conversations at all. I can't say anything without being completely shut down by everyone in the room. Including jokes about my virginity and about any rebuttal I make to dispute the fact. I remain quiet for the rest of the night leading to right now. The girl I like and my friend are spooning on the bedroll I laid out for them while I am stuck in a 50 degree room with no pillow, mattress, or blanket.\n\nTL;DR:",

The last couple of months we have had a kind of dead bedroom, with sex maybe 2-3 times a month (I know that this isn't exactly dead, so I'm not sure I'm entitled to complain). We didn't live together, and we both had hectic days so I guessed that this was the reason for our lack of sex. Three weeks ago we moved together. This was big for me. I thought that now we could start working on our dead bedroom. Unfortunately we only had sex one time the first week. I just thought that was because she was stressed out. So was I. The next week she got her period, so that kind of killed the sex part.\n\nSo, yesterday she was really sad. And I asked what was wrong. She then confessed to me that she had been having an affair with her friend. She haven't told me how long this has been happening, but it seems like it has been going on for a while.\n\nThe worst thing is that I was sickly jealous at her friend. And I was really paranoid that there was something going on. So I confronted her, but she told me that I didn't need to worry. So I felt really bad that I was this paranoid and jealous guy, that couldn't let her have a guy friend. So, I guess my suspicions was right the whole time.\n\nI don't know what to do yet. We have just moved together, and there will be hell to move out again. We have both been living with our parents, and there's no turning back now. I don't know if she's gonna quit seeing her friend, and I don't know if we're going to try to make this work. I know I can't forgive her for what she did, and I'm not sure I can just forget and put it behind me either.\n\nSo, do anybody have any tips? Been in a similar situation? And is it even possible to fix this kind of thing? Anything goes, I just need some perspective.\n\nTL;DR:",

Hopefully I've come to the right place.\n\nSo basically, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 months a few weeks ago. She was always really clingy and attached to me, even after I dumped her.\n\nWhile I was dating her, I made a Tumblr account by her suggestion, which is where my problem lies. When I dumped her, I made it very clear that I didn't want hide nor hair of her in my life anymore. But, she never bothered to unfollow my Tumblr, and it makes me slightly uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. The first one is entirely my fault -since she's still following me, I can't help but to keep checking back on her blog. This makes it really hard for me to forget her, and let her go, because no matter how many times I tell myself to stop looking, \nI can't control myself. The other reason can't really be helped -even though I made sure she knew I don't want any part of her in my life anymore, she still goes through my blog and likes my posts.  \n\nAll of this makes me really uncomfortable, but I'm not sure how to go about dealing with it. Should I just block her? Confront her? Am I overreacting? Am I being the dick here? I really don't know, and some help would be nice.\n\nTL;DR:",

Is that bad?\nPOST: Would love to hear from others in similar situations. I've been with my bf for about 4 years now and we're pretty much in it for the long haul. Neither of us are marriage people, but we're basically in that stage of our relationship, to give you an idea. We've lived together for most of our relationship and we've grown very comfortable with each other, which is great. \n\nNow, we're kind of drifting into that territory where the sex has decreased a lot. It went from 4-5 times a week to maybe once every 2-3 weeks. It's been a gradual fade so it's not shocking or anything. And it's not for lack of attraction; we're both quite affectionate otherwise and are still attracted to each other. But it does seem strange how little it bothers me that we don't really do it anymore. And he doesn't seem to mind either; he's quite outspoken and open about his emotions so it definitely would have come up a while ago if it had been bothering him. I guess my only concern is is this going to be detrimental to our relationship eventually? I've read about dead bedrooms and people becoming frustrated and resentful over not getting the amount of sex they want... But I don't think it's affected us at all. My sister told me that she and her husband of 9 years started scheduling sex after they had their second kid because otherwise it would happen way less, but that sounds really unappealing to me. Like a doctor's appointment or something. I think if it's going to happen it should happen organically... But what do I know. I'm pretty young and inexperienced with all this. Is this lack of interest in sex something we need to take a closer look at in our relationship or should we just let it be and assume that's just how we are? Are there couples out there who just don't care about how much sex they have and still have a healthy relationship?\n\nTL;DR:",

This girl has been my friend for 6-7 years all through college and the years after.  Me and this friend have never had sex or kissed or dated or anything, it has always been strictly friendship.  After a while my girlfriend told me she is uncomfortable with my and her close friendship and thinks that I am closer to my friend than her.  So I pretty much stop hanging out with this friend and only talk very occasionally.  However it is difficult since this friend is part of my circle of friends and is a good friend of my roommates and also a roommate of one of my very good friends.\n\nTo me this is an issue with her trusting me.  I have never cheated, nor came close to cheating on her with anyone.  I am a trustworthy person, I dont go out late partying or anything like that anymore.  And I know sometimes her ex's text her and she gives them quick blow-off replies and such but I never worry about it because I trust her.  I also don't like the idea of being told whom I can and cant be friends with if the relationship with this person is only based in friendship.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?

He does not have strong relationships with people other than me, he is very co-dependent, can show aspects of depression and anxiety, etc. For the 2nd time in our relationship I have discovered that he has been exchanging dirty messages with other people. I forgave him the first time because I blamed myself for not giving him adequate attention, plus I still corresponded with my ex against his wishes.

Why did she tell me that?\nPOST: I [m25] met a great woman [f29] at my community college a few weeks ago. On Tuesday I found out she was single from a mutual friend and then I asked her out on Thursday. We went to a restaurant, had a great date with good conversation. As we were walking to our cars in the parking lot, she motioned for a hug. Two long hugs later and a denied kiss attempt, we parted ways but we made promises to see each other soon. We really hit it off!\n\nA few hours after the date we are texting late into the night. She calls me after a few texts and then we end up talking for about an hour and a half.\n\nOk, this is the issue or question I have. At one point in the conversation, she became kind of weird and started to speak really softly. I don't know how the topic came up (we were kind of talking around our attraction to each other and past sexual experience), but she whispered very softly to me that she hadn't been on birth control in 8 years. I told her that I appreciate her telling me that, but it was her choice to be on birth control. I think the way she told me implied that she was guilty about it.\n\nI know some women don't like being on birth control. It affects them in weird ways. I'm just confused why she felt the need to tell me that. Is a woman NOT being on birth control a weird thing and\/or is it something a woman could feel guilty for?\nAnyway, I also told her that I ALWAYS use a condom.

Me and my best friend (males) were watching Brazzers beating it together. It progressed into stroking eachother. We agreed (during the act) this will never fucking happen again, ever. We will never speak of it. It will basically be the skeleton in the closet until the skeleton is dust and blows away in the wind. It did not progress into anything further. No anal stuff, no kissing, no oral, no part of this was out of attraction or feelings. This entire thing was purely out of curiosity. We both have girlfriends we are in love with (I feel my girl is THE ONE). Despite this experience, I would never consider myself bisexual or homosexual, the idea of another man is by no means enticing, tempting, or gets me aroused or excited whatsoever. As much as I would like to erase this experience completely, what's done is done. Nothing is awkward at this point, still buds, still do same old bro stuff (shooting, off roading, cigars). Curiosity was strongly present is all. Guys of Reddit, how many of you have \"experimented\" (to any extent), but your sexuality is not in question? \n\n**What's Going Through My Head Now**\nHonestly, I'm hard on myself when it comes to anything.

Reddit, it would just help to know that this is normal, I'm not a freak, and that not sharing this with **ANYBODY**, including my girlfriend, is ok.

We eventually moved in together, expecting nothing to happen. However, a kiss happened, and a lot of cuddling\/relationship talk happened.

We sneak out and cuddle and whatnot the second night, but it seems as though another girl liked him as well. She likes him, and I like him, but from what he says, he only likes me and does not like her. One night he tells me he is sleeping, but I find that he's in the room with that girl, alone. He sleeps over, and tells me nothing. He doesn't seem to tell me until i asked him, and I accept his apology, but am hurt because he lied\/avoided the question. Now we've talked and somewhat agreed that we should take a break, but I'm really vulnerable. I tell him that he can hang out with her because she doesn't know we were once in a relationship, but it hurts me a lot to see them together. I want to be\/stay in the relationship with him, but it seems he doesn't want to, and I will have to get over it.

Got back together 5 years later, now have been together 2 years and living together for 5 months. \n\nThe problem: I don't know if I want to stay in the relationship. \n\nHere's why: \nI recently came to terms with the fact that I'm an alcoholic (sober 4 months). I also have bipolar disorder (medication\/therapy managed). My father died 6 months ago and that sent me into kind of a tailspin. I then moved across the state to be with boyfriend and closer to my mom, and started a new job (which I love). I've been away from therapy for a few months due to this transition. Adjusting to living with boyfriend has not been easy...I require more space\/alone time than he does, and once you live with someone all the things that bugged you about them before become more pronounced. All this to say that I've been more moody\/touchy\/unstable than I was for the past year. Previously I had been ready to get married and spend my life with this guy, then about a month into living together it's like everything changed out of nowhere. And now I'm avoiding sex with him like the plague and sometimes the thought makes me physically ill. Confession: I started to develop feelings for someone else and I'm not quite sure if it's because he has been helping me in early sobriety or if it's more than that. Anyway, the point is that I now have some good days\/weeks where I feel like my old self and am ready to marry this guy again, other weeks I can't stand him. I feel guilty because I'm the one who cheated years ago, then I'm the one who begged him to take me back, so how could I leave after that?? So there's a lot of shit going on and I don't know where I'm at or what I should do. I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nTL;DR:",

I have been with my bf for 2.5 years and he has been friends with this person since high school. My problem is that when I am hanging out with my bf and his friend, the friend will be extremely touchy with me. For example he will kiss me in front of my bf, touch my ass\/boobs, try to cuddle me when I am trying to study, etc. He also makes comments about me getting naked or about having sex with me. In the past my bf and I had a threesome with this friend when we were drunk. My bf was very uncomfortable after this happened and we established that it would never happen again. Before this happened the friend did not act like this or make sexual comments. This is the first time he has acted like this towards me and it makes me feel very awkward. When he does these things I either tell him to stop, ask my bf to tell him to stop, or just get up and move somewhere else. However, my bf says that \"since he's already seen you naked\" and \"since you've already sucked his dick\" it doesn't matter what he does\/says to me. When I tell the friend directly to stop he tells me that I'm being mean and my bf then expects me to apologize. This is my bfs best friend so I am reluctant to make a big deal about it and potentially cause problems between me and my bf or between my bf and his friend. My question is, how do I approach this subject with my bf\/do I approach it at all or just stay silent? Not spending time with them is not a great option since in the we have been hanging out frequently and they will ask awkward questions if I just disappear for a few days.\n\nTL;DR:",

This job has the potential to be a long running career for him and although the company does have multiple locations in multiple states I'm not sure they will ever be in the state my family is in. Which is a problem for me. \n\nI'm very much in love with him, and can see us getting married someday however I feel as though I'm at a crossroads, where if I commit to him its commiting to a life without my loved ones. And I have a really close relationship with my whole family. I knew I was moving to be with him but I didn't want it to be a long term commitment. I brought it up with him and he agreed that he isn't including me in his future plans but didn't seem to want to alter them. \n\nBefore we moved, it was loosely agreed that we would stay down here for a few years, he would chip away at his student loans while I either went back to school or found a job and saved up. Which sounded fine, but as of late he's been talking a lot about staying for the next 5 or even 10 years. And I'm not sure that's going to change....\n\nTL;DR:",

We are both professionals in our fields and it's completely normal for him to work 55+ hours a week. My job is a little more manageable at 40 hours a week, but I also take on clients privately (would like to work for myself someday) and serve on a Board for a Not-for-Profit, which brings me more than on par with the hours he works. \n\nSo I get it, we're both busy, we're both stressed out a lot of the time, and the last thing anyone wants to do after work is housework, but I can't stand a mess, and Hubs is super stingy (hates ordering in, a maid would be out of the question), so I end up cooking 6 nights a week and taking on the bulk of the chores.\n\nMy problem is that we've HAD this conversation before. He's come home and seen me crying from exhaustion on the couch and we've talked about him pitching in more. He'll cook one or two meals, and then do a few chores, and things will be great for a few days\/weeks but then the novelty wears off and he's back to expecting me to do all the cooking\/cleaning.\n\nI've made a chore list for him in the past, but he won't exactly do things up to the standard I'm used to (his mother would not approve either, her house is immaculate), and when I try to show him a different way of doing it, it always ends up a tiff (I'm partially to blame, my patience lately has been non-existent). Ultimately I end up taking the chore on again in the end. \n\nWe plan on trying for children later in the year and I can't even imagine what kind of stresses that will bring if this isn't sorted out.\n\nTL;DR:",

It's been convenient that we've lived together because his car had broken down and we have been fortunate enough to get by using only my car. He's able to walk to school and use my car to get to\/from work. \n\nNow the opportunity for him to get a car has presented itself and he is considering moving back into his parent house to save money. He wants to stay together, but doesn't want the financial responsibility f living in an apartment. \n\nI'm devastated for multiple reasons. One being that he'd move out and I love having him around to come home to. And two, because although he doesn't pay much rent\/utilities he does help out and the money he gives me every month definitely helps me get by. \n\nIn my eyes it seems selfish to move out when I know he'll just be over all \nthe time anyway like he was before he moved in. Except now he won't be \"living\" with me so won't have the financial burden. He says he wants to live with me but has to look out for his best interest. But what about mine? The biggest reason I'm still in this damn state is because I love my bf and want to stay until he done school so we could start our lives elsewhere. \n\nI've sacrificed a lot for him, and now I feel like he's just looking out for what's convenient for him. \n\nBarring the financial stuff it really hurts my feelings he'd want to move out in the first place. I feel like him moving out is like backtracking in a relationship. And I wonder if it will suffer because of it. \n\nI need help reddit.

However, I was wondering why Bose-Einstein condensates never get the attention they deserve when people discuss cold fusion.  In my opinion, someone should throw a lot of money at this (there's only so many labs that can produce this condensate I'm sure).  \n\nIt just seems like a perfect environment for fusing particles as all the particles are in the same quantum state, indistinguishable from one another (where attractive and repelling forces between the atoms are crucial).  Not to mention in several experiments the atoms have imploded when critical mass of the condensate is reached.  Also, some experiments have reported missing atoms after the implosion\/supernova-like explosion.  Surely there is some way a condensate of this nature to be a source for many future technologies, whether it be cold fusion or atomic storage (i.e. putting lots of atoms in a singularity for storage).  I mean, I've never even heard anything close to this mentioned on the Science\/Discovery channel special (and you'll NEVER hear it in the news).\n\nTL;DR:",

I just am not sure of the best route to take. All I know is the interest is killing me. I guess I should start off by telling you what my debt is -\n\nI have a credit card which is my main killer. I currently have around $3,500 on this card. The interest is at around 25%. Every month, while I make payments 0f $200\u2026 it charges me at least $60 for interest. \nI have a credit account with Ideal Image. There is only about $1,500 left on this and the interest is at around 26%, however because the amount is lower it charges me around $3 per month for interest.\nI have a car loan and to be honest I am not sure how much my interest rate is on that, however I know I have around $9,000 left on it to pay and I pay $293 a month.\n\nI feel like this is a lot of debt for someone who is 23. I am managing fine I guess, but the credit card specifically is just not going away.\nI should probably also mention that I have just started college again and I was granted a subsidized student loan for $3,500. I know I will have to take out another next year as well. I don't have to worry about paying this back until I graduate in a few years, but I would like to be able to pay it back easily in the future and not have it just piled on top of what I already have.\nI guess my main question is to ask if I should take out a small personal loan of some type, that has a lower interest rate and pay off my credit card and Ideal Image. \nI hope I provided enough information.\n\nAny recommendations? Thank you so much in advance!\n\nTL;DR:",

During the relationship she was saying that I was the best boyfriend she had and she has never liked anyone more; we dated for 3 months and I basically said the same. The day after we broke up, she called me because she said she had no one to call about an incident, someone very close to her is in the hospital, and basically said that she was scared of me and that when she broke up with me a weight was lifted off her. I don't know what to do. I have turned to alcohol this past month or so and I don't think it's good. Sorry this is so messy but any advice of how I could talk to her would be great. I'll answer any questions\n\nTL;DR:",

The employee had to call the cop, file the report, and push through to higher up to get corporate to act on the security problem. \n\nWhen a fellow temp stole over $3600 she fired her via email and didn't have follow up investigation or punishment. That is more money than I take home in three months. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI am going to work for at least two week to be able to pay my cellphone bill and health insurance in advance if I do quit.

I didn't tip him and went to another salon begging someone there to fix the damage. I ended up losing another 4 inches to get my hair back the way I wanted.

Things had been going quite well, until last night he brought up that he's been having a feelings of 'what if.'\n\nFor the majority of the relationship we were long distance, but saw each other every other weekend. 3 weeks ago, we moved in with each other since we both now have jobs in the same area. Things seemed to be going pretty well. Then, throughout the last week, I noticed he wasn't hugging, kissing, touching me and things seemed strained for him. Finally, he let out that since I'm his first girlfriend, he is having feelings of 'what if there's someone better out there for me? How do I even know what I want since I've never dated anyone else?' and various related questions.\n\nI flat out asked him if he wanted to end things, but he constantly says \"I don't know, part of me wants to stay and part of me doesn't know\" (which I assume means part of him wants to leave). Upon prying a little more, he said that sometimes he feels like we are too similar and neither of us pushes the other to go out and do things... But this is untrue in my eyes. For the past 2 months, we have not had a free weekend because of going out and doing things. I also just moved into the area and started my first job, so I have been swamped with getting things in order (but trust me, I would love to go out and do things).\n\nMy question: How do I help him figure out what's best for him? Do I leave and give him space?\n\nTL;DR:",

We're both seniors in college and we're just honestly so excited to see what life has in store for the both of us. But I'll just admit this here: I've been sneaking him in so we can spend alone time with each other. My parents didn't know any of this was happening until my dad came home super early from work Friday and caught us. I was in the shower while my boyfriend was in my room, which is downstairs. I opened the window and made him hop my fence before my dad could see him. Needless to say, my dad and my mom have been very disappointed in me (for good reason) but my dad built up his anger against me and let it all go today. When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it. My excuse  (albeit a bad one I admit) was that I was helping my aunt and the rest of my family clean up their apartment's party room after the baby shower and I couldn't feel my phone vibrate. When we got home, he made faces at me (like he always does when he's angry at someone) he then asked me who came over Friday. I told him that it was a guy. He asked more questions like how long has this been going on, and why did he leave without seeing him. I answered him like \"a while now\" and \"because I was scared about what you would say\". I was crying a little at this point because I was just so scared of him and thats when he lunged at me with his fist. Thankfully my mom came just in time and I told her what happened.\n\nI understand I did something wrong and I really should have told my dad I was dating someone. Because of all these lies and shit I said and done I feel like I really deserved to get punched. I'm also really scared now and I just don't know what to do from here.\n\nTL;DR:",

Every night I go to bed I think of her. We haven't moved in yet or set a specific date to move in but I feel that I should bring my feelings up to her before we move in. We will begin looking for places in the next couple of months and I don't want to make the living situation awkward by bringing it up while we are living together and screwing everything up. \n\nI just don't know what to do in this situation.

I go to church with them once a week (they're fundamentalist Christians), I don't drink or go to parties and I work to pay for school. They cover my room and board, and occasionally drive me around. \n\nLast week however, I had a friend come up from Toronto, (about an hour and a half away.) I went to a movie with said friend (Magic Mike) and told my parents I was going to see Abe Lincoln. Ignoring the fact that it's not as terrible as it sounds, that I'm 22 and lying to my parents, my mother somehow found out. \n\nNow she's all cold and \"I'm too angry, we'll talk about it later\" and I want to be like \"no! We're not going to talk about it later. We're not going to talk about it ever, because it's none of your business.\" I appreciate what they've done for me, and they've been a huge help, especially in the last few months, but sometimes I want to tell them that parts of my life have nothing to do with them. \n\nI'm tired of not dating because they won't approve of the guys I date and sick of listening to her every single week, \"will you be in heaven with us?\"\n\nTL;DR:",

I brought it up and she claims she doesn't mind, but I definitely feel distance and coldness when I'm talking to her while she's doing something else.  I also try to keep in touch with her all the time, exchanging texts when I'm at work or she's in class, and talking online when we're both at home.\n\nI feel like I'm being immature, or in this case very 'clingy', and normally I play piano or games or just browse Reddit\/Youtube when I'm bored and not doing anything, but ever since I met her and things started getting somewhat serious, I can't focus on anything else other than \"oh shit what did i do why doesn't she want to talk to me now\".  Little pangs of jealousy kick in when she's doing something I can't do with her, but I know it's absolutely ridiculous to expect her attention constantly.\n\nI want to get this feeling out of my system before it starts becoming a serious problem.

They told me their screen printer had been closed for the holidays and my package would be sent out \"soon.\"\n\nAgain I waited over two weeks with no package. I direct messaged them again and they replied back saying that one of the totes full of packages had been left behind at the office and he would straighten it out on that coming tuesday. Two weeks again go by and I message him again. He states that my package had been sent out (coincidentally that same day, probably before replying to my message). I waited another two weeks and FINALLY the package arrived today.\n\nMy friend says I should definitely ask for a partial refund or discount because of the time it took to get the package. I missed christmas AND valentine's day as opportunities to give this gift, which really sucked.

I'm confused about the whole situation but somehow talk myself into that it's for the best. \n\nThe next day when I come home from school I see a bag on the doorstep. When I look inside its all the things I gave her through the time together. I was crushed. I felt betrayed, lonely, and couldn't understand what I did to deserve this. I quickly glance at her roommate's Facebook and see that they went out downtown and I think the worse. Of all the years I've known her, I've never seen her act like this.\n\nNow that it has been some time I am doing better.

In one of my classes is a girl I like, but unfortunately due to the class, there is very little chance to talk to her. \nSo the class in question is philosophy, which is very boring to sit through. At the end of the class the tutor says that he would like some of us to volunteer to present the next classes info to make it more interesting for us. \nI think to myself 'great this will be a good opportunity to show this girl how brave and confident I am' (ha). As I'm about to say that I'll do it, she jumps in and says she will do it!! \nNow, I know what you're thinking (because I was thinking it too) 'awesome, if I volunteer too then I will get the chance to work with her and get to know her a bit'. Well as the seconds tick by after her volunteering my brain shuts down. Literally I couldn't move or say anything. I tried, and failed, to volunteer myself up as tribute but didn't have the balls to say in front of everyone that I wanted to work with her. \n\nEnded up spending the rest of the day hiding in my car beating myself up for not having the balls to volunteer.\n\nTL;DR:",

An attorney ~2 hours north of here found *me* and after phone and in-person interviews, I got the job. \n\nHis first e-mail to me mentioned that my work as his contract paralegal would begin on July 5, and that I could expect to work around 25-30 hours a week. Although I was going to be working from home, on the 5th, I again made the 2-hour trip to his office to meet with him for the first time as an employee. For several hours, I navigated their software program, had my firm e-mail address set up, and met with him to review pending cases. He also gave me a significant amount of cases\/documents to begin reviewing, as well as a \"To Do\" list. I left around 5:30 and drove home with all this new information. Midday on the 6th, I got a call that he had passed away in the middle of the night. \n\nI don't mean to be callous, but from a professional standpoint, **what do I do in this situation?** Can I submit a bill for the time I spent traveling and working there? Do I just chalk it up to a bizarre experience and move on? Do I hang tight and see if they'll still have work for me once they get a grasp on things?\n\nHe was the only attorney at the firm, so it's not like I can just be re-assigned. I've been in (brief) contact with the rest of the staff, but they are all devastated and I don't get the sense that *anyone* knows what the fate of the firm will be.\n\nTL;DR:",

He was not at fault because the driver he hit made an improper left turn causing my husband to basically T-Bone the guy causing damage to the front passenger's side of his car. He has full coverage and Financial Responsibility (SR22) insurance because we are financing the vehicle. The other party was cited for an improper left turn, no insurance (minimum cov. insurance is required in IL), and driving on a suspended license. We filed the  claim the day after the accident online. A week later they mailed us the claim paperwork to fill out. One week after, they asked him to take the car to their approved auto body shop to have their adjuster look at the car. We persistently called about when the repairs would be done or quotes for repair and every time we would be thrown into a full mailbox and no one that actually answered would help or give us any information. The auto body tells us they are just waiting on the insurance company to approve starting the repairs. A month after the accident they asked us to send them a copy of the bill of sale and a history report of claims with his prior insurance (from which he had no claims.) Over two weeks ago they called my husband to say they are investigating the claim because he is married and I wasn't under the policy. The broker that signed us up asked us if we wanted to add me on and we declined to save money (Im under 25) and because I wouldn't be driving the car at all. So in two months, countless letters, and maybe 4 calls from them we have no car, no repairs, or even a repair quote. We don't have any money at all because to make matters worse my car was hit a week after his resulting in a total loss and a payout from my insurance. We used up all our \"rainy day\" savings to buy me a new car while waiting for my insurance to pay. We don't know what else to do other than hire a lawyer. Please help!\n\nTL;DR:",

Back in 2009 my current girlfriend and I graduated from college, me with a degree in accounting and her with a degree in marketing. It took me roughly a year to land a job in my career field; my girlfriend, however, was not so lucky. Taking menial and tedious jobs she tried to make the most of it. \n\nFast forward to 2012, she accepts a part-time job and makes the decision to return to school. This time, however, to take courses for her to able to attend Pharmacy school.\n\nEnrolling as a part-time student, she takes the necessary classes she needs to meet her Pharmacy prerequisites. However, because of the weird curriculum of her university, one of her classes doesn't meet the Pharmacy requirements and so ultimately she drops it in favor of a class that does. \n\nTwist occurs when it turns out the class that met her Pharmacy prerequisite does not meet her university's prerequisite for the upper level classes she needs. So now she has to take additional classes just to meet those prerequisites. This of course means that it will take her longer to take her PCATs and ultimately longer to get into Pharmacy school. She doesn't want to be in school the rest of her twenties nor does she want to be burdened with additional debt\/expenses while reaching her goal. \n\nI guess I'm unsure of what to do; I try to be supportive as possible, hearing her out, letting her express her frustrations but it doesn't seem to work. What are her or my options here? I don't wanna be useless.\n\nTL;DR:",

If I had some free time, he would be working or in school (does both full time).

I was crushed because I was really starting to like him and he even told me he had feelings for me as well. He said he just wants to work on himself for a while. I asked him if it's possible if things do work out in the future will he reconsider trying again. He didn't give me a straight answer saying it just depends on when it happens. \n\nSo my question for you \/r\/relationships is it possible to meet the right person at the wrong time?

If I see somebody I know walking towards me from 100 yards, I'll wait until they're two yards away to make eye contact and wave. I pretty much avoid eye contact before that so you don't have that awkward situation where you've both seen each other but you're too far to say hi yet. That's just how I work.\n\nThere's this cute girl that I met on one or two occasions (a couple of weeks ago) with some mutual friends just walking through our dorm. \n\nOne of the people I was with regularly says hi to her when passing, and he has only had a little more interaction with her than me.\n\nThe following scenario has happened a couple times between the time I met her and today:\n\nWe're walking towards each other on a sidewalk - we see and recognize each other from far away so BAM... I avoid eye contact until she's a couple yards away, and by that time I look up to say hi, but she thinks I'm not going to so she walks past looking the other way.\n\nAgain, that has happened a couple times. It is painfully awkward and I walk away making frustrated faces each time... \n\nToday when this happened the first time, it was the usual averting of eye contact, but then I looked back at her about 30 seconds later and she was looking back at me too.\n\nSo today after that happened once already... I saw her again in the same situation, except it wasn't quite as far. I waved... She gave the look of \"I see him waving, but it's probably not me because he never acknowledges me\". I decided to go in for the kill. I said \"Name of girl... Hey!\", waved again, gave a goofy grin, kind of laughed, and made my turn onto another sidewalk in a different direction, cringing and making faces not knowing if I should've just ignored her again. \n\nFor what it's worth, she was with a friend, said \"hey!\", gave a big grin, chuckled a little bit and waved.\n\nWHAT ON EARTH do you think she was thinking throughout all of this...

But still hangs out with her abusive ex from time to time.\n\nSummary of the entire thing:  She left me the first time because he \"got better\" which he obviously didn't.  He's now actually getting better, so am I crazy or is she actually going to go back with him?  (After saying very mean things about him\/telling she'd never go back ever).\n\nMy question?  I haven't initiated any text with her for the past 3 days.  I'm completely over her but scared I'm destroying this \"friendship\" she wants between us...  Before all of this I blocked her from everything and she went as far as emailing me saying that she wants to be unblocked or else she won't ever speak to me again.

I've grown up here in this small town in the country with my father, who has raised me selflessly, after my mother broke his heart and left 20 years ago. He worked tirelessly at the local factory and every dime he earned went towards my happiness and well-being. In the few hours he had between jobs he'd teach me baseball or build a sandbox out of out lumber we'd find walking the railroad tracks. I honestly don't know how that man worked so hard on almost no sleep, for years. He is the most selfless man I've ever known. He's worn the same clothes since I can remember, still uses our shoddy lawn mower that makes the job nearly impossible, but simply states, \"Well, It still runs.\" He's just that kind guy. Anyway, it's breaking my heart to leave him & I just need something.. something to give him, something to show him.. everything he means to me. I'm not talking about a new lawn mower or stuff he needs. There has to be way to sum up how much I acknowledge that, appreciate him, and will miss him or so dearly. I'm writing him a letter, but that's as far as I've gotten.\n\nBut I don't mean to stray away from the title itself, it doesn't have to be simply suggestions for him.

So he texted me and asked if I wanted to go to the play with him. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I technically agreed to go with Casey first, but if I show up with her and we run into each other, it'll be awkward. I don't know if I should invite him to tag along. Casey's recently been having some trouble with a couple of our friends who are dating and keep treating her like a third wheel, so I don't want to do that to her. Not to mention this is supposed to be a \"you're having a rough time so let's have a girls night\" kind of thing. But if I try to explain that to Jake I don't think he'll understand. I'm worried he'll get the impression that I'm not willing to make time for him.

Dave apparently was an asshole to everyone and if there's anything to take away from this story, it's to not piss off band geeks.\n\nMy roommate's high school band was traveling by bus to a school in a different city for a competition. Dave had been messing with the people in band all week and as a band member himself, would be accompanying them to the competition. The bus ride was going to take around 4-5 hours and a group of trombone guys (including my roommate) decided it would be a great opportunity to get back at Dave. They sneaked into the band room, opened Dave's trombone case, and stole his mouthpiece.\n\nOne by one, the guys took turns jacking off into it. One of the them stuck it up his ass. Another pissed on it.\n\nThey made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May. For 5 hours, that mouthpiece sat roasting in shit and piss and semen like a fetish-loving prostitute in the trunk of a car. When the bus finally stopped, Dave took it out and played his trombone as if not a single thing was wrong.\n\nTL;DR:",

I think it's a pretty standard case of me finding out that we're actually not compatible. There are no glaring problems, I'm just increasingly not happy in the relationship as a whole and I know I would be much happier single.\n\nThe problem is that I don't have any money. When I first moved, I couldn't find a job for 6 months. The city I moved to has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and despite a university degree and literally hundreds of applications, it took me a long time to finally find a part-time job in retail. During those 6 months, I used up all my savings even though my SO paid for the majority of the expenses. He can afford it since he has a very high paying job.\n\nNow I've reached the point where I've paid off my debt but just don't have the savings to live on my own. My city just happens to also be one of the most expensive places to live and I'm starting school again in the fall. I just can't figure out what my options are. My family doesn't live in the same place and I have commitments where I am so I can't just move back home.\n\nI've been keeping up appearances in my relationship for a couple months now but it's not fair to my SO and it's draining for me.

I do make pretty good grades, but I don't tell people my grades my wife does. \n\nI do not know what to do to make her feel like the center of attention. We have even had to switch churches because at our previous church all people would ask was how law school was going, and they seemed to ignore her.

[my first Weddit rant]\nPOST: Edit: what a convoluted title. \n\nI am so frustrated. We received an email from our wedding coordinator informing us that it was time to choose an officiant from the service (All Seasons) that is on contract with our venue. We went to their website and selected an officiant that really jumped out at both of us and submitted their web form, formally requesting him. A week later we received an email from them saying, \"[Venue] has contacted us to say you are getting married there. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, it's time to pick an officiant and confirm all of these details regarding the location, date, time, and overall vibe of your ceremony.\" I replied back saying I had already been in contact to request an officiant and I answered ALL of her questions, and said that we were still in the process of confirming our ceremony time and that I would let her know ASAP. The next day I emailed again to confirm ceremony time, and within ten minutes I received a reply from her saying, \"Thanks for confirming your ceremony time, can you answer everything else now?\" Uhm, I already did. So I replied back answering all of her questions again and reiterating our interest in this one specific officiant. Three days go by and I receive ANOTHER email from her saying, \"Great, now all that is left to do is confirm your ceremony time and we can check if the officiant you want is available.\" Arg! I just don't understand why they can't pay attention to the things that I've emailed them. Should I send back one email reconfirming all information start to finish? I think if I get another email asking me any of the same questions again I'm going to go nuclear. How hard is it? We are paying you $380 to officiate our wedding, I'd think the least you could do would be pay attention to us when we contact you.\n\n\/rant.\n\nTL;DR:",

I felt great and had what I considered a fairly lofty goal of 1:45 (8 minute mile x 13.1)\n\nSpent the miles chasing this older lady who didn't look like she should've been able to run as fast as she did. Passed her towards the end in a full on sprint to the finish. I felt awesome! Looked at my time and saw 1:37.\n\nMan it felt nice. But I found out a couple days later that someone working the route didn't know what they were doing and didn't direct runners down a little .8 mile dog leg. So I (and apparently a LOT of other people) only ran 12.3! Man I'm bummed. I would've gladly given up making it under my goal time in exchange for actually having run the full course! At least I have my plans for this weekend... I'm running a full 13.1 so I can finally say truthfully that I did it and get over the feeling of being cheated. \n\nEver have something like this happen on other courses?

I requested a $10,000 loan.\n\nThe way my credit was at the time, I had 100% on time payments with a 12 month credit history of payments, I also had a new line from Best Buy credit that has been going two months now. Prior to this loan request, I had a 678 score. \n\nShortly after talking with the dealer and running my credit, I decide that I'm not financially set enough to be buying a car. To add insult to injury, I find out over the next couple weeks that they contacted 18 various banks and credit unions for financing...all denying my loan. I would read each letter stating the reasons for denial and seeing my score drop... 658...647...630...625...and now finally 615 where I'm at the end of the inquiries. During this time, I managed to miss ONE payment from Best Buy which resulted in a single interest charge and double payment that I caught up on the next month. I am current on the payment of that now. \n\nI also applied for a credit card and I believe I was approved (since it was through my current bank) and I should be receiving one next week.\n\nTL;DR:",

I won because him ran out of breath and couldn't continue so I asked if he was alright then continued my routine swimming. A few days later at school I saw him and reminded him of his loss and said: \"dead lungs, haha\"(Yes, that sounded horrible and I don't know why I said that AT ALL). Then around a week later I heard a few teachers talking and saying that J has lung cancer! I confirmed that by asking certain people. Now I feel guilt every single day because J PROBABLY thinks I knew about his condition and I knowingly mocked him for it. He hasn't changed the way he treats me, but I feel genuinely bad. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

Your friends and family do something special for you, you get a few cool presents, and have something to eat.  \n\nBut now that I'm older, I'd rather pretend that my birthday doesn't exist.  I fear getting older and irrelevant, and hate knowing that my youth is behind me.  A few of my friends are around five years or so younger than me, and it's so cringe-inducing when I realize that they aren't familiar with the movies or music that I grew up with.  Turning 30 tomorrow is a milestone I'd rather not have to deal with.  I really am turning into a damn old man, at least mathematically, and I hate it.\n\nI've always gotten kind of depressed in recent years when my birthday is coming up.  It reminds me that I'm drifting further into irrelevance, that my best youthful days are behind me, and that another year has passed without me doing anything great with my life.  I'd rather just not acknowledge it.    In my head, I'd prefer to think that I'm still 19 years old without a care in the world.  Of course, a 40 hour a week office job and a mortgage makes that impossible, but at least I can dream.\n\nMy wife brought it up last week and asked what I wanted to do for my birthday.  I told her I'd just like to have a nice drink at home and watch a movie with her or just grill out some burgers with our friends or something like that.  But I know that they've probably got something crazy planned since I'm turning 30, and I honestly just dread it.  I don't know how to approach it, and I'm already kind of a nervous wreck over getting older anyways.  I feel guilty about it because I know they mean well, which is kind of hitting me and making me even more depressed about the whole deal.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to approach this?  How did you deal with a big age milestone?  Did it make you depressed too?  How do you suggest I go about this?\n\nTL;DR:",

I met a man (26m) online a few weeks ago and we have just started seeing each other face to face. He is everything he seemed to be. Our first day was Thursday night and we have gone out every night since. He fits the bill of what I'm looking for and he has told me I fit his. He asked me to be his exclusive girlfriend Saturday night on our third date, and I gleefully agreed.  \n  \nWe made out Saturday and Sunday nights and it's been great but I'm really trying to practice restraint. He has already said he's in no rush and is not pressuring me at all. In fact, we both have been very artful and skilled in letting up during our kissing when we notice the other getting too hot\/heavy.  \n  \nI've never been one to make out this quickly let alone have sex so soon, but fireworks are flying. In my gut, I feel like he could be a long term keeper and he has already expressed the same. He's ready to show me off to his family. So I don't want to do anything too quickly and possibly ruin our relationship's chances at going the distance.   \n  \nBasically, an opportunity is coming up this weekend. Its technically past the one week mark of us seeing each other face- to-face rather than just phone\/text\/email. We are connecting on every level and conversation flows freely. I feel the relationship so far is more than physical. I feel mentally, physically and emotionally ready if he is also.\n\nTL;DR:",

We both knew that the relationship might not last forever because she is a foreign student and when she finishes studying she wants to travel. Until yesterday we hadn't spoken about what that meant for the relationship but we had often discussed her future plans. \n\nShe is a very sunny and loving person so when I couldn't get two words out of her yesterday I knew something was up. It took her about 5 hours to work up to telling me that she didn't want to get 'attached' because she would be leaving in a year. But that she still wanted to keep seeing me without the title BF & GF. \n\nI explained that I couldn't do that, or at least I don't think I can. I'm already attached and not humanly in control enough of my emotions to not get more attached as time passes. So whatever happens I feel like I lose, either we break up (which neither of us want) and deny ourselves present happiness to save future pain or we keep going and I have to constantly monitor my affections. \n\nPerhaps she is only bringing this up because she is getting attached and that scary her because of our possibly difficult future\n\nWe haven't reached a decision yet but I don't know what to do.

We share a lot of common interests and hobbies and we work together. Our relationship has had some ups and downs (My ex fell in love with her, she rejected him and I forgave him, just to dump him later) but lately, there is something that has been bothering me.\nI cannot speak with her the way I used to; I do not want to tell her about some things I do, about the guy I am dating, or about anything else that is not related directly to her. She got angry when I told her some things about my life, and she seems to need the assurance that I am going to be there for her all the time. Also, she knows how to manipulate me and make me feel like everything bad that happens is my fault. I know she has problems at home but I am simply not able to give her that much attention, specially since she is the type of girl who gets a lot of attention for being pretty and interesting and all that.\nSo, right now, I do not know what to do: I don\u00b4t want to \"save\" her from her problems, because I tried and it only went for the worse, I just want to stop feeling like I am walking among eggshells with her, and that anything I do in our relationship is wrong or it does not fit on what she wants.\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR:",

Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day. This taints the better part of our relationship, but not enough for either of us to want to end it. Although, we did break up about 5 months ago for maybe a week. (It was a drunken break up)\n\nIf I were to describe our relationship from his point of view, you all would probably think I was a psycho. I'm clingy and have a temper. I can be too sensitive and crave attention. Honestly, I hate it, and he knows I hate it. Change isn't easy to come by, and there are some emotional\/depression\/self esteem issues I should work out on my own.\n\nI guess my question is, how can I change my attitude to be a better girlfriend? Or should we break up for a while so I don't feel so attached to him? I see so much potential in our future together and love him dearly. I just want to make the right choices.\n\nTL;DR:",

We talk often about school, work, and personal stuff. Although we're both kind of shy, I feel like I can trust talking to her about a lot of things I keep everyone else shut out from, and she does the same. I like to think that she has a thing for me, because over the past few months I've developed feelings for her. She's just a really outstanding, mature, all-around beatiful person and we have a lot in common. However, I've never been in a romantic relationship (she's single).\n\nMy worry is that I might be getting the wrong signals from her - we've been great friends for a long time and I don't want to do anything to risk that. I really need help with how I can approach telling her how I feel about her without endangering our friendship. Please point me in the right direction!\n\nTL;DR:",

Today, i was busy and didnt go to grab the last bags until 3.  I am off shift at 4, so that still gave me plenty of time.\n\nBefore i could go upstairs, a member of the housekeeping team noticed the bags were still there and became very upset.  She burst into the laundry room and began yelling at me about the issue.\n\nI was shocked at her behavior, but calmly stated that i was on my way to get the bags and had not forgotten.  She kept yelling, becoming increasingly aggressive.\n\nI asked her politely to stop, and mentioned that in the future a polite conversation is all it takes if she has an issue with me.\n\nHer response to this was to call me a racist ( she is Chinese), and accuse me of not listening to my housekeeper co-workers because they are Asian.\n\nI told her that the conversation was over if she was going to accuse me of racism.  I will not be speaking to her without a manager present from now on.\n\nI immediately sent a message to my direct supervisor who was off today, and plan on visiting the hotel tomorrow to speak to the general manager.\n\nI really need this job, I am a student.  Otherwise, i cant see myself working somewhere where I am going to be verbally harassed and called a racist.\n\nReddit, any tips?  I would like some outsider opinions because I am still feeling shaken up by this incident.\n\nHonestly, I have never seen an adult behave this way and I am not sure how to address it.\n\nI would also like to note that there was another person working in laundry with me that day, who was not yelled at despite the fact that we share responsibilities.

I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!\n\nAnd I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit. One post was something along the lines of: (Dealing with confidence issues) \"Just fake it until you make it.\" Another post was a very informative post on askreddit about tips for when you actually do get interviews that said that s\/he added at the end of the interview, when asked if s\/he had any questions said: \"What can I do or say today that will give me this job tomorrow?\" (I totally said this!)\n\nTL;DR:",

He's my best friend and we get along really well. He's a good boyfriend to me and we have a lot of fun together. He gets along great with my friends and family. However, lately the relationship feels stagnant and it seems like there is no future. I think the reason I feel this way is he has never communicated his feelings towards me and I am starting to develop stronger feelings towards him. We haven't said I love you, even though I do feel that way about him and have said it to him. I believe that saying those words shouldn't be rushed but he told me he doesn't know if he can be in love...ever. He doesn't know if he loves his family and he often feels \"nothing\" towards people.  I think he might be suffering from some form of depression. If I try to talk about our relationship it usually turns into a fight where he totally shuts down. I've asked him several times if he wants to be together and that if he wants out we can still be friends. He always says he wants to be together when I give him this option. \n\nWe talked this weekend about it and he admitted he thinks he might have depression because he feels very up and down all the time and often feels \"nothing\" and wants to \"disappear.\" He said he doesn't know if he'll ever have strong enough feelings to be in love and that he's had this same problem in his last relationship.\n\nPart of me thinks he is suffering from depression and that things could change and that I should be there for him but part of me thinks it's stupid for me to hold out for someone who may never feel strongly enough about me in the way I need. I would like to stress that otherwise things are really great between us, we have the same interests, the same sense of humor, and he is truly my best friend.\n\nTL;DR:",

We made plans in advance for yesterday and we agreed that it would be a date\/hangout mix. He let me know in advance that these sort of things made him a bit nervous and that he's a little shy in person. He drove about 30 minutes to get here. \n\nSo as soon as we met, we grabbed some dinner. With better lighting, I could see him more clearly and he was super attractive. It was about 8pm when we got in, and we literally stayed in the restaurant until it closed at 11 just talking. He paid for the meal while I was in the bathroom. After that, we decided to just drive around. I asked him if he had to be home at any time and he said it really didn't matter. \n\nThe whole date was just a lot of talking and getting to know each other. Near the end of it there was a lot of humor and teasing. He asked me if this was one of my better Tinder dates, and I said definitely. I asked him if he would wanna meet again sometime and he said for sure. However, when the end of the date came (12:30am, my curfew),  and when we were sitting in front of my house, I was super confused with the body language. I felt as if I was being really awkward because I unbuckled my seatbelt and looked at him and lingered for a while. He did look into my eyes and at my lips a couple of times, but then he'd turn away and look out the window. We both awkwardly\/nervously laughed.  I'm used to guys kissing on the first date it if goes well so I felt bad at this point and so I went home. Wasn't sure if he wanted to kiss or not so I didn't go in for it.\n\nHe texted me when he got home \"You're probably asleep, but, OH MY GOD. IM FINALLY HOME. Let's just say I'm stupid and made a very wrong turn lol\"\n\nWould he have made an excuse to leave earlier if the date was going badly? Do you think he's still interested?\n\nTL;DR:",

We have been together for 2.5 years and the past few times we have hung out, we have not had sex or he rebuffed my advances. He chalked it up to low energy and stress a few things which I understood, but it just felt very off. Not only could I not recall when we were having sex but when we did it wasn't good at all. At first he didn't agree with my sentiment about less sex, and in fact decided to point out my own shortcomings (regarding domestic tasks) but he took the initiative to initiate and it's been great. In fact, we've been having some  of the best sessions we've ever had, and I feel that he used techniques he's never used before (sorry if it's TMI). I thought we were happy.\n\nThe next morning, we were joking around and it came to the point where I jokingly mentioned that he was trying to turn me into a housewife and he mentioned I was trying to turn him into a sex slave. That threw me off, but I let it go because I assumed he was joking. However, the very next day we were recalling the previous night's session and how much he enjoyed it. I casually brought up the sex slave comment. He then goes on to show the apparently grotesque face I made multiple times and how I was basically forcing his head.\n\nIt seemed like it was in the vein of joking but I felt humiliated. I feel sex is such a vulnerable state and his comments made me feel that he wasn't really into it and having a laugh at my expense, perhaps even resentful that he had to.  When I brought up that what he said was rude, he noted that he was just kidding and didn't mean anything by it. But isn't there a truth in joking? It makes me feel like I can't voice my concerns and now I feel insecure about doing those acts. Am I just being over sensitive?\n\nTL;DR:",

There are two aspects to this: will it help us in the way I think it will, and are there other ways to obtain similar benefits as a married couple has. \n\nThe thought process: \nPrimarily, my husband just graduated college in December with nearly $100,000 in loans, about half through Sallie Mae. I did not cosign on any of these. Since he has not found a job as of yet and only has a couple months left before repayment begins, the thought is that if we remain married, they will a) consider my income when evaluating deferment or income-based repayment, and b) hold me liable for the loans after a certain time period (10 years, I believe?). If we divorce now, my income -should- no longer be considered in repayment and I won't be held accountable for the loans since they were entirely his, entirely used for his tuition, and I have received no benefit.\n\nYes, I know our taxes will go up, but I'm guessing not the $800 - $1000 a month his payments will be.\n\nAdditionally, at the moment he is carried on my insurance because Covered California counts my income and it makes him ineligible. If we divorce, theoretically he could then qualify for subsidized insurance, possibly at a lower cost than my coverage. \n\nIf this is correct and we decide to divorce, are there other documents we can have to ensure certain benefits - Power of attorney, medical rights, etc. I know tax rates and insurance aren't possible to affect, but what other documents can serve to ensure we have rights to make hospitalization\/medical decisions and financial decisions should the need arise?\n\nTL;DR:",

We've had our ups and downs, as any long distance relationship does, but we've been very good at communicating and, honestly, everything is perfect apart from the distance. I have never had any reason to suspect anything suspicious and I trust her.\n\nLast night, at midnight, she told me she was going to her university library to get some books. She texted me along the way (in the uber) and when she arrived. I told her to text me when she was leaving as I was worried because it was late and she did (1.5 hours later).\n\nNow, here are the inconsistencies. I do not want to reveal too many details due to privacy or in case someone she knows reads this. She said she would get these books and study there. When she texted me on her way back, she said she didn't study because she had to obtain files from the university computers which her professor had emailed them saying would be deleted (apparently emailed them at midnight..).\n\nThat is all fine, we say good night when she gets home and everything is great. I go on her email later to check her calendar and out of mere curiosity I open an Uber receipt that was sitting there. The time code and date both match the trip, but the address is not her university. Also, there was no uber receipt for her way back (maybe it was deleted, or it was never sent? I do not know how uber works, I never used it).\n\nI was really scared and called her in the middle of the night to ask her what was going on. She said it must be an old receipt and I felt like shit for suspecting anything. She said she could show me the books she got and even the 'new' receipt (whenever that arrives). I apologized profusely and that was it. But I am now starting to worry. Does Uber send receipts immediately? Should I suspect anything?\n\nTL;DR:",

Last August, I (29M) started working full time after a LONG period of unemployment. Before that I worked freelance as a graphic\/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15\/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life\/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500\/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there. I miss the freedom that came with freelance work, but having a steady paycheck is certainly nice. It's very tough to find a job in my area, so on one hand I feel lucky to be in the situation I'm in, but on the other I feel like I can do much better.\n\nTL;DR:",

She also cheated on me in the end.\nPOST: Background information: I'm 26. She was my first official girlfriend. We've been together for more than one year, but in the last couple of weeks we didn't put enough energy into the relationship anymore. I expected her to break up with me on Friday when she told me 'I need to tell you something'. Actually she did broke up with me AND then told me that she cheated two weeks ago. This is an actual text I sent her yesterday:\n\nI need to tell you something. This won't be nice for you, but I need to say it. Like you told me that story about Paddy. When I heard about it on Friday, I honestly thought that I can deal with it. My reaction was honest and I meant every word I said. I wasn't even mad at you.\n\nBut since then it hurts more with every day. Yesterday I cried for the first time when I was at my brother's home and just now I did it again at training. It is the first time I am feeling this and it sucks hard.\n\nAnd it was unnecessary. You could have broke up and then fucked whoever you wanted. I didn't need to know then. \n\nAnd it was no random mistake, because you slept with him twice. I know that I am partly to blame for this, too. That is my biggest problem. Had I treated you like you deserve it (Yes, I still think you are awesome), it wouldn't have happened. And you know that this is the actual reason. You just didn't want to tell me that. Therefore sentences like \"it's not your fault, it's mine\" are simply clich\u00e9. \n\nI don't hate you. Far from it. I miss you every day, even though I hate to admit it. But all those things I didn't tell you on Friday, so I had to do it now. That you cheated on me, did hurt me and it sucks.\n\nTL;DR:",

But as of lately our conversations have become more than just friendly conversations (many more compliments given to me \/  slight flirting). There was a point where we were walking together and our hands kept bumping into each other and we kind of just gave each other this stare... almost as if we both wanted to hold hands.

If I looked at my phone, he would either immediately look at his as well, or look at it a few seconds later. If I crossed my arms, he would too. If I had my hands resting under my chin, he would do the same thing or at least be touching his chin. But again we barely looked at each other.\n\nI've noticed other moments of mirroring the past month too, but what exactly does this mean?

He often suggests eating out and our meals usually cost $20-30, tips included (which is one hour of work for him). He always asks for one check and pays for the meal. I always go to his place for the weekend because my dorm room is super small, so we don't cook and just eat out maybe three times over the weekend.\n\nI feel bad about letting him pay but I can't afford dinner for two so sometimes I buy him a drink or get movie tickets. I still feel bad about him paying for almost everything so how do I go about this? Should I just let him pay (he doesn't seem to mind at all but it bothers me. I don't want to be a gold-digger)? Please give me some suggestion! \n\nHe also paid for everything (dinner and drinks) on our first date, even though I said I'd buy him a drink since he already got dinner.

She told me she felt terrible and that she still loves me and that it meant nothing to her. So I asked her to come visit me next weekend so we could talk about it.\n\nI talked to a friend of mine about it and he said if I want her back, then it shouldn't matter what she did.

In this particular lab we were using a little bowl called a crucible.  The crucible was still wet after being washed at the end of the last class, therefore the first instruction was to heat it over a burner to dry it out. \n\nWe heated the crucible for the required two minutes and sat it at the table to cool, as it was cooling I began to read the instructions for the next step, which required us to find its  mass. My mind had begun to wander from the lab, when I remembered what needed to be done. I promptly said \"Let me just mass this.\" I grabbed the crucible. The blazing hot, just heated by fire for two minutes crucible. It burned, seeking to remove it from my hand and stop the pain. I flung it to the ground and it shattered. \n\nThe looks I received from my teacher and the other students were those of bewilderment.

We have checked our file and these letters were intended for a XYZ who was a driver involved in an accident with our insured.  He provided this address (the ones on the letter) to our policy holder at the time of the accident.  You may disregard these letters and we will update our claim file to reflect the address we have is incorrect.\nShould you have any other questions, please contact us at the number below.\n\ni then replied to the dmv and sent them the whole stack of correspondence, saying they had the wrong person, and i was suspecting possible identity \/ insurance fraud. the dmv sent back a letter in typical bureaucratic fashion, saying they would check their records to make sure they had the right info, and they would contact the other party, and mentioned nothing about the fraud or identity theft. shortly after, they sent another letter saying the party didn't respond, so this thing was off \"my\" record... for now.\n\nhere comes the good part: i get a letter from the dmv saying \"my\" vehicle was not registered, and it included the offending car's license plate, and the DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. i was able to look up the plate, after discovering the smog check lookup in this [thread](\n\nso, what's is going on here??\n\nTL;DR:",

I did not have any clue about how to date, and my confidence was so low that I didn't even feel like a woman any more. Soooooo, I got sick of being overweight and eventually lost 35 pounds. \n\nMet a great guy when renting a U-Haul (he owns the rental place) and he flirted with me. I didn't think anything of it cause I didn't think he could possibly like ME. Then, he asked me over to watch a game one night...and we never made it to the end of the game. He apparently liked my body even if I didn't, and I was on cloud 9. Went out a couple more times, then he inexplicably dropped off the face of the earth for 4 weeks.\n\n  I was hurt, but took it philosophically and signed up for a dating site - I am very sexually oriented, so I found a few \"encounters\" and started to relax a bit and enjoy being single. \n\nThen, he called me up & we resumed a ?relationship? - and we truly like each other as people, but had sex every time we met (apparently strong attraction both sides)\n\nRecently texted me & said he wanted more than just sex, and wanted to get to know me more. I said I wanted that, too. He then said that it would not be in my best interests to spend more time with him. Huh? What? My brain hurts. I asked him point blank if he wanted to break things off, and he said \"by no means!\"\n\nI like him lots, he is a good person, he has brought himself out of a lot of dark places, and I didn't expect to like him so much. \n\nI think IFU by having sex with him too soon.

By the end most people left, and she lived far so she crashed at my place. We were cuddling outside while people were indoors, and after they left we started to dance, which then lead to making out, and she got topless, but it didn't progress past that. We also slept in the same bed that night. Basically, I don't know what happens now since I've always been pretty quiet and awkward and never in this situation. She's attractive, but she's not my type, plus my last relationship was great but ended due to long distance and it still stings.

I invited him round again yesterday to see if he wanted to spend the night at mine and we'd go into university together the next day and he hasnt responded at all even though it was originally his idea that never ended up happening.

We had a nice time at the cinema a few weeks ago and since then its felt like he's gradually trying to distance himself.\n\nI dont think it's even anything to do with me being too clingy or anything - which I thought might possibly happen - when I look back at the texts from last month he always replied quickly and we seemed to be getting on well.

Not very long, but I feel like he's the best boyfriend I've ever had- at least the most romantic and thoughtful. He's so many things I feel like I want in a man: open-minded, smart, somewhat adventurous, thoughtful, sweet. He's even open to moving around (not always easy to find in Southern LA guys), has an adventurous appetite, AND is great in bed. He's VERY good at communicating, and understands himself well emotionally. He's the most affectionate, thoughtful, and communicative boyfriend I've ever had. But I've been unhappy. Almost this whole time. I don't know if it's the relationship or if I'm overthinking and taking things personally. Or maybe both? I feel like there's something wrong with me that I can't seem to enjoy a relationship with this wonderful guy who's worst characteristics come down to laziness, not having his life 'figured out', and being a bit quirkier than most of my friends. I keep telling myself that we can be happy, that I'm just getting in my own way with negative thoughts, but I have trouble stopping those negative thoughts. \n\nMy friends and family think this friendly, charismatic nerd is so wonderful and such a great match for me, but I don't know. \n\nIn past relationships, and now, I have a problem with maintaining my independence\/being happy when alone.

I could tell we were an instant click so by the end o the day she gave me her phone number and she told me where she lived which, coincidentally, is about half an hour away from me.

Today in class we talked about Motivation and Emotion, covering a chapter per day as usual. One of the topics is the Drive Reduction Theory of Motivation, where physiological needs cause internal drives and the organism acts to satisfy the need, and tension is reduced. We tied it to sex because college kids, and the issues of meeting online people for sex came up (Tinder, Craigslist, Grindr) and then someone compared that scenario to an Uber taxi, since the driver of the Uber is a stranger. I talked about how one Uber driver locked the back doors of his vehicle and started masturbating next to the female passenger.\n\nExcept I made the hand motion while I told the class that the guy was masturbating. \n\nSo my professor busts out laughing, my friends bust out laughing (our class is like 10 people so we're all friends here) and the guys at the end of the table who couldn't see my hand motion asked me to do it again. They probably thought I'd actually SEEN the video and not just heard about it.

Should I confront her?\nPOST: OK so first the background details. We've been together 4 years and live together. I truly love her and had planned on proposing to her later this year. 2 weeks ago she broke up with me over a silly fight. Said she need time to herself blah blah blah. I was devastated as I didn't see it coming. The weird part is she currently has been living with me after the breakup and will be here until next week which is when she will move out.\n\nNow for the juicy part. Today i opened her laptop and she was signed into her email. I found numerous chat logs of her and a male co worker talking sexually and she even had sent him a nude photo. These texts go back to November. Normally i don't like to snoop around so I feel super guilty, but I had been having suspicions all along. I remember about 3 months back her entire attitude had changed and she became more distant which is around the time she had also mentioned that there was a guy in her office who liked her. This is the guys shes been chatting with.\n\nNow, even though we are broken up I don't know what to do. Should I tell her I know? Even though it means exposing myself as having gone through her email? Should I just let it go? I feel like shit because this coworker of hers is married and basically I think instigated this whole ordeal for her to break up with me? Either way I'm at a loss.\n\nTL;DR:",

So minus airplane travel, that is like 13-14 days in between.\n\nI am trying to plan the trip now, but I feel a little overwhelmed, so I thought I'd ask all you guys. (Reddit is usually my google) I kind of want to try to plan some sort of trail that leads us to Berlin throughout that time, but also seeing amazing and beautiful things (specific I know).\n\nWe're two guys, both 21, and not afraid to rough it. I was thinking at looking at those help-ex sites and couch surfing. Cheaper the better, and I dont mind doing work to support my stay. A major thing we both love is nature, so I want to encompass those sights, but not miss out on the city too.\n\nSo, my question to you guys; any suggestions? Sights I need to see, things I need to do, things I shouldn't do? Great places to stay in, terrible places? Some sort of magical convenient trail that can show us awesome things on our way to Berlin? \n\nI know this is broad as all hell, but I feel like I am being dropped in the ocean and I have to navigate something.

My uncle has a beautiful\/crazy fox red Golden retriever named Remmy. I decided to bring my new camera along, pop a few photos of some happy dogs.

I've been lurking\/randomly posting here on Reddit for the past couple weeks and I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality of responses that the community provides!  Sooo... I've decided to post something I've been having difficulty with.\n\nI'm 24 years old and have never been in an intimate relationship with anyone and have always struggled with my how to interact with people on the personal level.  Things are getting better and I've actually had some success with the ladies! (first kiss at 22, ftw!).  I'm an avid weight lifter, have a good career ahead of me, and am now beginning to dive into the world of classy fashion (goal this year is to get a bespoke suit).  I believe that the general public finds me attractive and that I'm perceived as \"easily approachable\" and friendly.  So I have no issues with approaching folks and starting up conversations.  \n\nI believe that with me, the issue lies within empathetically listening to the other person.  For some reason whenever I am conversing with someone my mind switches into problem solving mode or I start telling a story that will somehow make it seem like I relate to them.  Whatever they are talking about my mind starts clunking away at it and then I spurt out a logical solution.  This works great if they are seeking my advice (so I'm awesome at the workplace) but it's absolutely terrible when say a pretty lady or a friend is sharing some intimate details with me and I can't keep my trap shut long enough to let them adequately tell the story so we can make a connection of some sort.\n\nRight now I'm slowly (very slowly) getting better at biting my tongue when talking to the opposite sex and also realizing that most people don't want their problems solved, they just want to talk and for you to understand.\n\nSo my question to you ladies and gentlemen is, what tips can you give me on becoming a better listener?  And how can I continue to improve and learn how to have deep bonding conversations with other people?\n\nI'm really looking forward to reading your responses!\n\nTL;DR:",

Should we \"wait and see\"?\nPOST: We're 28, living together for a year, together for almost two years now, known each other for several years. We love each other deeply and have no major issues. Marriage is often discussed.\n\n*My argument:* \nI do not ever want children, and unless something neurological drastically changes, I doubt that I will change my mind. I do not like children, do not want to spend money on them, and do not feel rewarded by the time I spend with them.\n\nI am considering getting my tubes tied at some point (in the next five years), and currently have an IUD.\n\n*His argument:* My boyfriend thinks that I will love children if they have my genes. I suspect he is right: if somehow someone forced me to have children, I would probably love it, because it is helpless and it needs someone to love it, and it is mine after all.\n\nBF says my life won't be ruined as he will be the SAHD, will make sure we have plenty of money socked away pregnancy.\n\n*My Offer:* I told him that before we turn 30, he has to spend a week caring for a child. And if he still wants a child, we will have another talk. It's possible my biological clock will somehow kick in, but it is unlikely.\n\n*His Offer:* BF says he will essentially be a single father if he has to, and raise the child by himself with a donated ovum\/surrogate. But he doesn't want to leave me. This seems absurd to me, because if I am with him, I will be the secondary caregiver. His life will be different; he will presumably be a different person.\n\n\"We will work things out somehow,\" is his refrain. He doesn't want to think about how much of a dealbreaker this issue is.\n\n*Questions*: Is it time for us to break up, or do I really need to wait the extra two years? Is my BF's offer reasonable, or could it never work?\n\nI am very grateful for any responses, and if you need any more details, let me know.\n\nTL;DR:",

To top it all off, because my roommate and landlord have \"bad blood\" he hasn't be paying rent. This only came to light for me because the Marshall came and took the apartment for 24hours.

After the lack of rent paying came about, I informed him that I would no longer be paying him directly, and wanted to pay the landlord instead.

In the morning she gave me her number and we've been texting a fair amount since then. \n\nLast week I asked her out for drinks and she said she may be busy but might be able to do Friday. She bailed on going out on the Friday as she'd been out the night before but said she'd definitely see me this week.\n\nSo I asked her tuesday if she wanted to do something Wednesday and she again said maybe as she thought she already had plans with her friend. She then text me late yesterday afternoon to say she's busy.\n\nSo I went out with my best friend who works with her and he got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She said she's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and thinks I've forgotten and doesn't really want to get into a relationship. She had mentioned both of these things the night I got with her but she'd also said she didn't like one night stands so I have no idea what I was.\n\nHonestly I just can't quite understand why you'd say your up for going out with someone then do everything you can to avoid it. I'd begun to think she didn't want to as she wouldn't give me an idea when she could go out when I tried to ask her.\n\nJust looking for some advice on what to do next. I feel like she is attracted to me but doesn't want to get to deep into things. Should I just ask her if she doesn't actually want to see me or just stop trying to set stuff up with her and move on?\n\nTL;DR:",

All was fine we visited each other often when we could,\n\nShe tells me she's going to prom and going with her girlfriends which I was fine with since the rest of her friends are single and have no-one to go with, this was the plan until the day before prom when her male friend decided he wanted to go and would be going with them. (They've been friends for a few years in school Im sure he did have a crush on her at one point)\n\nThe message said \"I might be going to prom with matt now\" which to me says I'm going with this one person as a date. I told her I didn't like it but she said that it was more of he's just joining her and her group of friends for the night and he would only come if he got to say he was going with her.\n\nProm night comes and goes all is ok , until the next day when I start seeing pictures, first its of them stood near each other which hurt but I passed it off as ok. \n\nI started talking to her about the photo's and how there were non of them together in a couple like shot and she said \"yeah no way i wouldn't do that\" ... well she did and now I'm really mad and not sure how to confront her.\nShe did offer to not go with him but since she stated it wasn't a date or she was even going with and it was simply him joining her friend circle I told her no as I didn't want to come off as controlling.\n\nTL;DR:",

She is the shy nervous type, but I loved that about her. After 1 year and 7 months I had to move for school, which led into a long distance relationship.\n\nThe distance really was difficult for both of us. She worked a night schedule and I worked a day schedule but we still managed to call every night. After a while, I tried to convince her to move to my side of the state. She did not really like her job that much (under payed) and I had a hard time finding a job on her side of the state (2 hours away). \n\nShe expressed a feeling of not knowing what she wanted to do with her career, leading her to not be able to commit looking for work near me. She was always really nervous with decisions and really feared drastic change. So I didn't push her, even though the distance was getting too both of us. She has to do whats best for her.\n\nSuddenly, that excuse ended up ending the relationship. She acted distant randomly as I visited her for the week (this was later in the week) and I called her out on it. She told me she doesn't know what she wants for her life and wants to be alone at this point in her life. She told me she loved me and as I left her house, I told her I hope shes finds what makes her happy and that I loved her. We were both in tears as I walked down her porch.\n\nIt has been a week since then and I am up-and-down each day. Happy,Sad,Confident, Self-loathing, miserable, ecstatic and most of all confused. I do still love her and I really don't know how to analyze what I am feeling. The breakup was out of nowhere.

One loves everyone (after he growls and barks at you) and the other one trusts NO ONE but me. I got them both from the SPCA. The skittish dog is a Shiba Inu\/Italian Greyhound mix and he's always been afraid of pretty much everything. \n        When I brought him home he immediately hid underneath my bed but I won his trust with some bread crusts and after that he's been my shadow. This dog follows me EVERYWHERE (besides the bathroom, he hates baths). If I go upstairs, he goes upstairs. If I sit on the couch, he sits on the couch. \n    Problem is, I've been dating my boyfriend for soon to be 3 years and have lived with him since November. My other dog loves him but my boy Haku doesn't really trust him or anyone. He won't sit in his lap or next to him and won't run or play with him. He only wants to be with me. I know it's gotta be frustrating for my boyfriend because he does try to bond with Haku but Haku doesn't really let him. Haku has become less afraid of him but still won't do much with him. I'm just wondering if there are any good ways for them to bond more. When we go for a walk, he walks Haku. He gives him treats and everything. But more than that, Haku won't have it. If he tries to run with Haku with him leashed, Haku will whine and look back and be miserable. \n    Is there any way to get my dog to want to be with my boyfriend more than he already does?

From the second I met her, I immediately thought that I had never seen anyone as gorgeous as she was.  I'll spare you the gooey details, but just assume that I became immediately crazy about her.

Well, it has been over a year, I haven't seen her in person the whole time, and I'm still as, if not more, crazy about her.

Can you invest the money in the fund? Does the employer offer a rate or is the \"match up\" amount the only amount you get?\n\nIf this being the case wouldn't it be much better in the long term to invest in stocks as historically the stock market is said to have a 10-11% growth on average (so no doubt there would be ridiculous downs and ups in between a few decades).\n\nI am going to basic training in a few weeks and is the first time i ever had money. So I want to make a wise decision.\n\nOne of the things i have to think about is college. If i decide to put aside a large chunk of the money I receive into the 401(k) then that money shouldn't be used for college as it would be deducted. I understand that the military will pay for some college through the GI Bill, however perhaps I decide to become a doctor and require additional schooling. Then instead of having invested money into the 401(k) wouldn't it have been wiser to have saved the money for schooling instead of investing it?\n\nUnfortunately my parents and friends are hopeless resources for this kind of information.

Am on mobile so sorry for any spelling\/grammatical errors. \n\nI've organised my work secret santa\/kris kringle this year as I do every year. Our team has a few interstate people so they're included too. It was all opt-in and anyone interested signed up via the Elfster link so it wasn't like I pressured anyone into participating who didn't want to. It's a $20 limit\/budget. It's up to the gift giver too if they want to reveal their identity at the end.\n\nAs I'm friends with a lot of people in the office, I already know who a lot of people have as they've asked me what to get their secret santas. One guy who is interstate (let's call him Dougie) told me he has my work friend Trish. He was in town this week so when I saw him he gave me his gift for Trish so i could hang onto it for him and give it to her next week when we do the exchange. \n\nYou guys - He told me he picked it up from a 7-11 on his way to our work xmas party. It's a little blue wooden clock that looks like he got it from the $2 shop. Not to mention - Trish was with him waiting outside when he ran in to get it and was joking that he was probably getting his secret santa present from a convenience store. \n\nWhat do I do? He's given it to me to wrap and give to her. I really want to spend my own money and give her a different gift (like a word of the day calendar or something she would actually like - English isn't her first language) or maybe just drop it at her desk anonymously the morning of - but my husband is saying it's not my problem. But it's such a shitty present... she's going to be really disappointed when she opens it. Help.\n\nTL;DR:",

Duration 16 years.\nPOST: Tonight I came home a bit early and found my husband in a tiny skirt. \n\nApparently he bought it just last weekend as a lark when I was traveling for work. But now he says it might be that he wants to wear women's clothing every day at home. This is all a bit sudden for me.\n\nHe has always had a pantyhose fetish. He wants to include pantyhose in sex; otherwise he has trouble staying focused. I'll wear them, but what he really likes is him wearing them. I'm okay with this but not EVERY time we have sex. Unfortunately, he mostly seems to be interested when we include the hose.\n\nHe insists on me accepting him as he is and his fetish. Which is as it should be, but for him accepting it means he doesn't have to try sex any other way. He does not go down on me because he doesn't like it. We have no spontaneous sex because for him it's a big production with the hose and the dressing up and the setup. For two years I've asked him to indulge my super vanilla fantasy of having sex in the shower, but no - he says sex and water don't go together and that he's just uncomfortable. Basically, we do it his way (in bed in the evening, lights on, curtains drawn, with the hose) or not at all.\n\nI've always been attracted to him though because he is a big masculine guy and that is my type. I like strong masculine men. But now he wants to be feminine. Every day. At home. I have no idea how I'm going to be sexually attracted to that version of him. And he says I am cruel and unaccepting if I can't.\n\nI also cannot help but think that this is something that has been going on for a long while and he's been hiding it from me. It's hard to believe he got his first item of clothing just a few days before I caught him wearing it. And now I wonder what else he's hiding. \n\nAm I a horrible wife for having trouble with all this?\n\nTL;DR:",

On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.\n\nHowever I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:\n\na) Am not really that interested in her. \n\nb) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. \n\nc) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.\n\nd) Am growing up\/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.\n\ne) All of the above\n\nTL;DR:",

There were no indications of it--no balloons or decorations--Dream Me just knew. I looked out the window and it wasn't my street. I was in my room but the neighborhood was not mine. Also, I think my Asian friend was walking down the sidewalk (Dream Me deduced that bitch was leaving my birthday party early). \nAnyway, I pulled on one of my teeth and half of it came off. It was disintegrating like a cement putty almost. Then once I thought I had pulled out all of them, I got really excited because I could finally rub my gums together like a baby or an old person. In addition, I remember being really excited because having no teeth meant I could eat pudding for the rest of my life. But then I realized my bottom teeth were still there and my top teeth still had the cement-like upper half. \nThat's all I remember; holding the remnants of my chalky teeth wondering if I could still eat pudding forever even though I still had 75% of my teeth. \n\nAnyway, I thought this was real life because I couldn't find toothpaste the night before and hadn't brushed my teeth.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm a pretty confident, outgoing woman and have asked out men on several occasions. I don't tend to be too shy if I really want something, however, can be in some situations. \n\nI was at the grocery store today at lunch time and was waiting in line to check out. There was a woman who was having difficulty checking out with her multiple credit cards and people in line were noticeably getting impatient. There were two people in front of me in line, and the person directly in front of me was a very cute guy. Sometimes in these situations people kind of glance around to others waiting for visual commiseration of some sort, surely many of you reading have probably experienced this. \n\nThe cute guy kind of glanced back at me and smiled but I had one of my headphones in listening to music, so I nodded back. I kept noticing him kind of attempting to look my way (or possibly he was just annoyed and waiting, hard to tell). \n\nI kept thinking, \"huh, I'd love to find a way to give this guy my number\". It's hard enough to meet people you think are attractive or interested in dating. I haven't had any real luck with online dating (especially in my current city, which defaults to a hook up culture) and have been thinking about how to meet people in person. \n\nSo I put this to you: how does one takes this kind of situation to the next level? Is it possible to ask someone out with little to no pre-text? Obviously it's risky, you never know someone's situation, but is it just plain weird or gutsy and admirable?\n\nTL;DR:",

But I match with this one girl on the second day on the app and was able to see meet with her that weekend. And yeah, she didn't turn out to be a psycho or anything and she was actually pretty chill(she drinks and smokes occasionally with a college degree\/job). We didn't hit it off right away, but after a few drinks we were able to expand and talk about life a bit more. We had dinner and took off to sight see and it became a pretty lame 8th bench date type of thing since I really didn't know how to escalate but it was still chill. She told me and I could tell that she was an avid tinder user so I was a little intimidated since this being my first time out and all. I don't know if she was bored at all or just wanted to hook up but I had a pretty good experience either way. Dropped her back off and was back on my way. This sound like a typical exchange on tinder or did I majorly fuck up in some way?\n\nHow many matches do you asian brothers get typically?\n\nTL;DR:",

I found out my ex lied to me about several things from the begining of our relationship.  So this morning I went and got tested for all STDs the results don't get back until NLT Monday.  All I do right now is think the worst, and waiting until Monday is stressing me out.  All I can think about it is this crazy story I've made up in my head.  Now a little background, I'm 22 I have some rather big plans for my future and someday having a family is a high priority amoung those plans.  I would never dream of hurting anyone, I work with young kids at a taekwondo school in my town on a regular basis in addition to my big boy job.  But for whatever reason, I keep picturing getting the results back and them being positive for something uncureable and killing all of my future plans, effectively ruining my life.  I then go to confront the ex about it and find out they knew the entire time and knowingly gave me an uncureable terminal disease (I know AIDS isn't technically terminal itself and you can live a long time with it if you stay healthy, but what the hell is the point if you can't achieve your goals with it?).  As you might be able to imagine, my blood goes to instant boil at the thought of losing my future because this insolent fuck took it upon themselves to lie and cut my own life short.  I don't know if I would actually be able to do it, but the scene that continues plagueing my mind is, after hearing that my ex knowingly gave me this, I brutally kill them with a knife and accept whatever consequences ensue.  But after my blood cools off, I feel like shit for even thinking about doing it.  I'm stressing out like a mother fucker. >: \/\n\nTL;DR:",

However, his mother has advanced MS and has recently been through a few surgeries, and obviously has ongoing serious medical issues. She is also very depressed and difficult to be around--this summer I visited for a week, and by the end I was going crazy. She's a very strong woman, and has compensated for not being able to do a lot of things by telling other people what they should do, which gets trying very quickly. This is made worse by the fact that I'm in med school, and so she wants to confide in me all the problems she's having with all her doctors and complain about the care she's received. (This is a trait which has already alienated many friends and family members who live near her.) We're staying in the house with them and there is really no space for me to get away from the situation or have time to myself. Last christmas, she and the bf got into a fight about the very same \"telling people what to do\" issue, which ended up giving her a severe flare-up that put her in the hospital for four days during and after Christmas. Boyfriend feels guilty about this and really wants this Christmas to be better, and I'm just feeling a lot of dread.\n\nReddit, I want to be a good person and be kind, but I also don't want my christmas (the only break I get in the middle of a really killer med school year year) to be totally filled with medical problems and family drama in a family that isn't mine.\n\nTL;DR:",

So we have been dating almost 3 months now. Other than me, she has only had one long term relationship and it was far longer, they dated for 2 years. The reason they broke up is her boyfriend didn't know what he wanted to be gender wise. She wasn't the one who broke up with him and she was clearly upset about it for a long time. \n\nShe broke up with her boyfriend around summer of 2015. So it was pretty recently, but I learned yesterday that they had been having sex since they broke up up until January\/February of 2016. She and her ex do still talk over snapchat and text messaging, but it's pretty rare and from what I have seen the little conversations they do have aren't inappropriate and more of a conversation friends would have. \n\nWhat is bothering me is her explanation for why she wouldn't have sex with him again, she said she would have no reason to since she now can have sex with me whenever she wants. The reason this bugs me so much is she is planning on going on either a year long or summer long trip after she graduates. And I won't see her at all or very little during that time, and if she has no problem with emotionless sex I am concerned cheating is a very real possibility.\n\nHowever this is my first real relationship and I may just be insecure.\n\nTL;DR:",

It's about 2 AM on Saturday and my SO and I are having a good time up in the loft bed. I'm on top and my SO asks me to spin around. Instead of spinning around as I usually do, I (like an idiot) decide it would be a better idea to stand up and get back on again obviously forgetting that the fan is on, at full speed naturally. \n\nAs I attempt to stand up, the fan clocks me right in the side of the head just above my temple. My head whips to the side from the force of the blow and I fall down clutching my head. As I'm laying there trying not to cry, I hear me SO ask if I'm okay. I try to compose myself before asking and my SO asks me to please say something or at least make a noise.\n\nMy SO is freaking out because I might be knocked out and it would be weird to try to explain to our parents why I had to go to the hospital. Through gritted teeth I manage to say \"I'm trying not to cry\" as I sniffle and the waterworks start. My SO holds me and tells me it's okay and I'll be fine. Then we both start laughing after my SO says that even though it hurt, this has to be the funniest sex injury. But boy did that kill the mood. \n\nThe next morning I wake up to a numb on my head about an inch or two long and about a half inch tall. Swallowing hurts, chewing hurts, yawning hurts, and basically anything that requires jaw muscles hurts. I think in a couple days my head wound will be completely gone, but I can manage a lot of things with a minor twinge of pain.\n\nTL;DR:",

However, from what I gathered, it seems like the author had a humorous experience where they tried to stand up in a loft bed while a fan was on at full speed, which resulted in the fan hitting them in the head. They were initially worried about their injury, but their partner calmed them down and they ended up laughing about the situation. The author also mentioned that they had a small wound on their head but it was not serious, and they experienced some discomfort when swallowing, chewing, and yawning.",

About a month ago, I proposed, and she accepted. Marriage was something we had been talking about for months. We both wanted it, so the proposal itself was just procedural. Our relationship has been perfect. I honestly think we've fought twice over the last 4 years. She is the love of my life.\n\nA bit about our relationship: We met on a dating website. We've been happily living together for the last 3 years. Money has not ever been an issue for us. We split things down the middle. My half comes from my job and her half comes from her parents, as she just recently graduated college and is still looking for a job. My GF's parents are well-off. Very well-off. It's obvious just from their lifestyle, and the way the support their only daughter. I have a good relationship with them. I think (thought?) they liked me we we met.\n\nMy GF told her parents immediately after the proposal and everything was great. They expressed their happiness, and actually flew down the following day. Nothing about a pre-nup was mentioned to me or her.\n\nThen, yesterday, my GF told me that her father called her and asked her if she was getting a pre-nup. She told him no, and apparently they got into an argument. My GF later told me what happened, and told me that he \"demanded\" she get a pre-nup and threatened to cut her off if she didn't. Her feeling right now is that she is mad at them and she isn't going to fold to their demand. \n\nI have a lot of problems with this. First, her parents seem to think they can control her and by extension me. Second, the fact that they used threats. Third, the fact that this didn't come up until a month AFTER we announced our engagement. Forth, what it means they think of our relationship. \n\nI don't know what is going to happen right now, hopefully this whole thing will \"go away\" but if push comes to shove I'm trying to decide if I will sign on the dotted line. Should I?\n\nTL;DR:",

As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.\n\nOur state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.\n\nThe trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer. Long story short, she's going to lie on her taxes and file as \"Single\" and obviously I have to as well. \n\nI am incredibly uncomfortable with lying on my taxes but both she and her mom (who was, to be fair, a tax attorney) think it should be okay for one year. I would imagine most people wouldn't lie to say they were *single* on their taxes, so I guess there's that.\n\nI don't see a realistic way for us to afford coverage through my employer, unfortunately. I'd love for this to be a \"put my foot down\" moment but if that results in her losing coverage I don't think I can justify it.\n\nWe all have to make sacrifices in marriage ... is this a reasonable one for me to make? I guess worst-case scenario is we get caught and busted for a large fine. Which puts us back on square one (or square 0.5, due to the fines ...)\n\nTL;DR:",

She is extremely spoiled and self centred.\n\nHer personal hygiene is so bad, she can't wipe her own ass nor bath properly because she is too overweight to reach her own bottom and other body parts that need washing.\n\nWe flew in yesterday to stay for the holidays and when she opened the door we were all overwhelmed with a mix of the odour from her body, excessive dust and other horrible smells that I was shocked and didn't know what to say, so I said nothing.\n\nI opened the window of the bedroom we are staying in so I could breath, but woke up with a headache and my nose was full of grey and black bits of dust or whatever is in the air.\n\nMy youngest daughter said she was having trouble breathing, and I assume this was due to the amount of dust in the air.\n\nIt is very clear that my MIL never cleans her apartment.  The toilet had a black in it below the water line, and shit all over the seat on both sides.  \n\nThe floors are so dirty I don't want to take my shoes off.  There are cobwebs everywhere and dust all over her books and trinkets (she is a hoarder although not overly extreme compared to those hoarding shows on television).\n\nAbout an hour after waking I told my husband we had to find an alternate place to stay because I wasn't spending my vacation time cleaning someone else's filth, and clearly it wasn't healthy for us to stay with his mom.\n\nAlternately, I suggested he ask his mom if she is prepared to split the cost of a cleaning company to come in if they can asap (may be difficult so close to Christmas).\n\nI am pissed anyone could expect a family member to live in this filth.

Afterwards she told me that she was not interested in relationships (or even sex) because she had just had a drug-induced psychosis at that time.\n\nWe began hanging out as friends which was ok for me because I had dates with other women and didn't mind us just being friends.\n\nA few weeks ago we started meeting in a more date-like setting and I started becoming interested in her again.I decided to tell her that I wanted to date her. We agreed to meet late in the evening in the garden in front of her apartement block. There she gave me all this talk about her being complicated etc. All while letting me touch and finally kiss her (like 10 times). I suggested that she took some time to think about our relationship. We met yesterday.\n\nWithin a minute she told me that she a) had never thought about me during the last week b) thinks our kiss was \"unnatural\" and c) thinks we shouldn't meet anymore (even as friends).\n\nI'm confused now and decided that it probably is best to forget about her. She seems emotionally unstable and would probably just suck off my energy in the long run. Do you guys agree? Should I break off all contact?\n\nTL;DR:",

My girlfriend comes from a family of two little sisters, mother and father. Her parents are separated, (her father seems fine) but her mother is really poor off... We went to her mother's house today and there was a notice from the water company, saying they owe hundreds and their water will be shut off soon. They have a hard time putting food on the table, but her mother just bought a new car. \n\nWhat I'm confused about is whether or not this is an issue of her mother not being able to budget\/prioritize properly, or if she just doesnt make enough money...She's a high school teacher and also picks up hours at Home Depot when she can. My girlfriend has a job, and her mother takes nearly all of the money she makes from her bank account without asking. Her mother also seems to be housing a \"boyfriend\", I use that term lightly, because I don't think he adds any income to the house and is mooching; he sleeps there, and when he is not in the house, he has their car. My girlfriend has found marijuana in their car after he's been smoking in it (something no one in that house does). Her mom hasn't commented on this guy's situation yet.\n\nI really worry about the safety of the girls in their house, because their front door doesn't lock and the \"boyfriend\" refuses to talk to the girls or me, which only leads me to believe he's shady. \n\nGot any ideas as to what I should do? I want to make sure the girls are safe, and I don't want their water shut off. I'm in no position to give them money, and that's not what I want to do, but this situation really is putting stress on our relationship. I'm very ok with her venting about the situation, but I would like some answers or advice to give her. I'm really trying to be a man here, but I don't want to get too involved and take on responsibilities that I can't handle.\n\nTL;DR:",

Since she is in a sorority and me a fraternity, I know a lot of her friends and when I asked them about her they were quick to tell me she's the perfect girl personality wise for me. So, one of our mutual friends who is really close to this girl told her about me and told me she wanted to meet me, gave me her number, and said it would be okay to text her so I did. We had a decent conversation going and it abruptly stopped. It was late, she probably fell asleep. So I followed the double texting rule and waited three days to try to reach out again. After I got the conversation going I asked her if she would like to meet me for coffee and she said she wouldn't be able to that week because of how busy she was with a weeklong philanthropy event. Even though she kept the conversation going for a while (that abruptly stopped again) I took it as a rejection and decided I wouldn't press it again. After that, I told another mutual friend who sits next to her in class and she said she actually was really busy with this philanthropy event and not to take it personal and that she'd talk to her about relationships without mentioning my name. So they talked and this girl told her a guy had been mean to her and she wanted to focus on school.\n\nThis was about three weeks ago, and her close friend said she'd give it one more try. I want to.

I was out of shape, emotionally unstable and generally unhappy.\n\nSo with this introspection I set on a path of self improvement. I work out daily now, did some therapy, graduated uni and got a great new job and even improved my wardrobe. I've made new friends and reconnected with old ones (male and female), and I've been on more fun adventures in the past year than I probably had been my whole life.\n\nYet somehow with all that, I feel like I'm become less attractive to women. I haven't done anything sexual with a woman since my breakup a year and half ago (hooked up with my ex a couple times post breakup but that's it). For a long time I didn't let it bother me as I was focusing on myself and making myself a whole happy person, but now that I'm finally 100% where I want to be, it's starting to erode my confidence and almost hurt my progress. I'm the type of guy who's been to bothered by my lack of height (5'7) but now I'm suddenly really self conscious about it since it's the only thing I CANT change about myself. Is it just that in this tinder-age sex revolution some of us are just bound to left behind? Am I self-sabotaging myself somehow? Is there some part of my self-improvement that I'm missing?\n\nTL;DR:",

We met online and had instant chemistry. We had a rocky start because he is very progressive and I am extremely old fashioned. The first time he told me he loved me was, I think, more of a cover up for the fact that he also revealed he'd gotten a girl pregnant just before dating me. He told her he didn't want anything to do with it and that I was his priority. Probably my first indication to run. \n\nLater I found he had been talking to ex's back in his hometown(very far away from where we are) and I wanted to call it quits at that point. I decided not to because I had already fallen in love with him and trusted him when he said he's change. \n\nDon't get me wrong, he makes me ecstatically happy, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed. We talk about marriage and children a lot. Now we have picked up our lives and moved together to an entirely new city so that we both could have better jobs, but I think I need a fresh start and probably a break from men who do not know what it means to be exclusive. Also I find he texts women from work more often than he should. He has a lot of female interaction on his job and I don't trust him with it. This is what sparked my post.\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been together nearly 4 years. I am going to be attending grad school and she is in undergraduate school. We have lived together for a year and we're pretty boring people. We're both introverts and have had maybe two fights through the duration of our relationship. I'm flexible and she's flexible. There has been no cheating or jealousy feuds. Sex maybe once per 1.5 weeks on average. You can said we are 'content' or 'happy.' We're best friends.\n\nAround Christmas time last year a member of her close family died and she's really starting to develop her relationship with God. I've noticed her becoming more distant and I suspected it's because she's re-evaluating what she wants in a partner and in life. We've had a talk before about Christianity. She wants a Christian husband with Christian values (all of which are the same of mine; I was raised Catholic\/Protestant). It's important for her partner to be Christian because it has something to do with purity of marriage and how that helps you build a closer relationship to God. She wants to better serve God in any way she can. I respect her views and her motives. I went to church with her last weekend.\n\nAbout two weeks ago when I was kissing her before bed she said that she doesn't want to have sex out of marriage anymore and that doing it makes her feel guilty. I'm flexible, but this one is definitely a curve-ball. We've talked about marriage and agree that we're far too young, and want to wait until we are 28-29 years old to get married. 6 Years is a long time without sex. She's okay with that wait. Sex is important to me because I believe that it creates and shows love and also it's fun. I just don't believe you have to get married to do it. \n\nIt might be easy for you to type \"just break up,\" but if you haven't built something for 4 years, it's a little more difficult to understand why this isn't easy especially because we're good friends in good standing.\n\nAnyone have any insight?\n\nTL;DR:",

Now understand that I have fallen on a tough patch with girls in general over the last 4 months i.e. friend zone, after friend zone. Its truly the most depressing thing right now, but maybe this post will help.\n\nMy question:\nOne of the girls is my next door neighbor in the dorms, like 10 feet away. She is in my group of friends and is in the common area frequently. If I were to say that I wanted to not talk to her for a while, how would I go about doing that?\n\nThe second girl is the only other person in my Calculus class who is open for study seshes in the same time periods as I am. She and I also think very similarly when it comes to math, so we work really well together, and if we get really stuck, who ever is available to go to office hours can report back to the other person. If I were to say that I wanted to not talk to her for a while, how should I break things off?\n\nTL;DR:",

Ohio, and for those of you who don't know, foundry work is some of the dirtiest, nastiest, toughest work around.  10 hour days are the minimum around here, and guys routinely log 60+hours a week like it's no big deal.  We've got one crew who averages 13.5, 6 days a week.  If it's 90 degrees outside, it's 140 next to the metal.\n\nAnyway, it recently came to my attention that one of the guys around here is illiterate.  Straight up, can't read or write.  He rides his bicycle about 18 miles (one-way) to get to work if he can't find a ride.  He's in his early 50's, prepares molds for finishing, and drinks a case of PBR every single night.  That's ALL I know about this dude.\n\nSo I got to thinking:  How the hell does he survive?  So much of society today depends on basic reading and writing skills.  I don't want to ask him because I think it'd be a phenomenally rude thing to do, and in my experience people that can't read or write get pretty defensive about it.\n\nI'm over the fact that he never picked up these skills earlier in life.  Whether he's stupid\/lazy, has a learning disability, or just had a set of circumstances that prevented him from getting this basic education.  I've put that from my mind and am now just trying to wrap my head around how he operates in the world.\n\nHow do people like this sign a lease?  Buy things in stores?  Manage money? Navigate to a new place? \n\nNow, immigrants who don't speak English and mentally challenged people are a different case. Usually they've got a support network to fall back on, or someone to watch over them.  As far as I know, this dude is on his own.\n\nSo Reddit, any insight, or anecdotes about people you know in the same situation?\n\nTL;DR:",

I was wondering if you guys could please help me out with some advice on asking a girl out. I met this [F23], Elizabeth (pseudonym), last year at university while she and I were in a one year program together - we never met prior to this. We spent the better part of a year in close proximity, having mutual friends and hanging out. From the moment I saw her I was attracted - she was smart and pretty. Unfortunately, I could never get myself to ask her out. A part of me kept saying she's not interested because I never talked to her everyday, just whenever there was the occasional get together with mutual friends would there be some small talk. With the program over since last December 2014, I have never been able to get her off my mind. I have her on Facebook and I have her cell phone number, but I've never messaged her. I really want to ask her out, but I don't know what to do. Also, she lives in a different city than I do (~45 mins away). What should I do? Your help is greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird.

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day?

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day?

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day?

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day?

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day?

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff? Its weird, it seems to me that this guy is actually afraid of sex or something of that sort...\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff? Its weird, it seems to me that this guy is actually afraid of sex or something of that sort...\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff? Its weird, it seems to me that this guy is actually afraid of sex or something of that sort...\n\nTL;DR:",

I'll start.\nPOST: 8 years ago, as a sophmore, me and my buddies went to his car and smoked a bowl between classes, we show up to our next class about 5 minutes late, and the teacher being a bitch said we had to go to the office and sign in, so we do, and the office secretary obviously knew we were high so about 10 minutes after signing in, we're called into the office, I had a pipe and a 10 sack in my backpack so at this point I was shitting bricks, they placed me in this small ass 4x4 printer room with the yard duty. I knew I was screwed because the room was so small I had no chance to hide my stuff. I opened the small pocket of my backpack where everything was, and took out a pencil. I started twirling the pencil around in my hand and noticed that the yard duty was watching the pencil, so i keep doing that and then I flick it up in the air. As it falls to the ground, I reach for it, and with my other hand I grab my pipe and slide it under the printer. When my principal was done interrogating my friend I was called in. She had just escorted him to another room to sit until they figured out to do with us. I walk out the printer room, see she is across the room from her office, so I B-line into her office grab the weed and put it on the book case. Cop gets called in to search my things, and he's tripping because he keeps saying he could smell it. It was literally behind his head nose level. After searching my stuff 4 times he gives up. They lock me in the office and tell me to wait while the police officer talks to my principle. When I was alone for about 5 minutes, I took the weed off the bookcase and hid it in her desk drawer. I ended up getting suspended for being high and they tried to tell my mom I have a drug problem and wanted me to go to rehab. My mom pretty much laughed in her face and told her it's just marijuana. Never heard about it again, but the teacher did \"resign\" at the end of the year.\n\nTL;DR:",

My family (minus me) & dads girlfriend went away on vacation for a week to visit my dads grandparents, and apparently it didn't go so well.

But he's been secretive about what he has gotten her for Christmas and has said somethings that seem to hint he's proposed to her.\n\nI want to approach this situation in a calm manner, but I'm not sure how.  I know I'll be quite annoyed and offended if he doesn't tell us soon (one of his weird things is to keep important information from people, like not telling his parents that my sibling is having a baby), and so I don't want it to get to the point where he eventually tells us and I'll have trouble forgiving him for not even talking to us about it until he's planning the wedding or some shit.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm a year ahead of her and we met through a mutual friend and kind of hit it off. Since about November we've been hooking up, each time we go out together she ends up sleeping over and we have sex, cuddle and chat in the mornings, etc. She had previously been in a long term relationship before coming to college and ended it about a month before we started hooking up. \n\nHere's the thing - she says she doesn't want anything serious between us. The problem is I'm freaking infatuated with this girl and can't stop thinking about her - we get along so well and sex is great. We just click, yet she is adamant about just being fuckbuddies-ish and not getting serious. (I say 'ish' because I don't know what the fuck we are) Don't get me wrong, I'm always down for a no strings attached thing but I'm afraid I've got myself in too deep.. I'm really starting to develop feelings and don't know how to proceed. Another thing to note is she's slept with 2 people, her ex boyfriend and myself while I've slept with 14 (she knows this) which could impact her decision? Maybe.\n\nAnyways, I don't want to tell her all that in case she gets cold feet\/nervous that I'm more into her, yet she's always sending mixed signals. Like, she told me shed be super jealous if I ever hooked up with another girl and we talk daily (texting, calls, on campus) yet she doesn't seem to want to be \"exclusive\" even though we basically are... I'm just really looking for some guidance here. I'm fine with going with the flow, but at this point'im scared getting too involved will end in me getting hurt. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

Could also use advice for a potential date with her.\nPOST: I'm on my phone so sorry for any potential formating issues. \n\nI've been into a girl on my MA course for some time now. However, although my friends point out that she is into me and flirting, I never seem to notice it, and simply pass it off as her being friendly. \n\nEvery couple of weeks we go to a new restraunt together, and we have no problem filling our time together with laughs and conversation, but I'm concerned that they are just viewed as a friendship thing. Very little touching, for example, goes on. \n\nTonight we met up with some friends at another person's house to hang out. At the end of the night, as it was pouring down with rain, she said I could stay at hers. I've done this before and it's been pretty innocent. Although I was planning to, I realise I couldn't afford a ticket (she did say I could pay her back) back home so I said no. I'm worried she might take this as an out right rejection for any potential relationship. Did I fuck up by turning down the offer? \n\nShe is going home for a week tomorrow, and when she gets back, I've agreed to pick her up and we're going to a local city together. Does anyone have any tips on how to make this... Explicitly a date?\n\nTL;DR:",

Really hoping to meet some new people!\n\nI'm really excited to start this adventure and during my time working and saving I will be studying and planning this trip. All information is helpful. I am especially interested in understanding the state of the economy, what type of VISA I should apply for (if any), what to pack and bring, and most defintelly I am looking for people who might be interested to take us in for a few days and\/or provide us with work.\n\nThink of it as bumming around Europe..

She had a history with drugs (meth and heroin) and theft, but her parents were unwilling to just put her out on the street. \n\nB agreed to take her in for a couple months to get her away from bad influences back home, and things were looking up. C started at a public uni with a clean slate, and B began a new job working long hours to support rent for two. C also began to identify as a male around this time (not sure if that's too relevant). Our friend group was supportive of both of them, and they would come hang out together from time to time.\n\nSeveral weeks later, B told me privately of C stealing marijuana and prescription painkillers from his (locked) room. I was shocked, because I had thought things were on the upswing judging from the few times I had seen them, but apparently C had failed every single one of his freshman classes. \n\nC began verbally abusing B and disrespecting (and stealing) his belongings in their apartment and leaving it a mess. B has replaced his locks, but confided in me that he has begun to hate living with C. His lease does not end until the 4th quarter of this year, and I hurts me to know that he works so hard for his sibling and gets treated like this in return.\n\nI've offered to keep some of his valuables at my place away from C, and couch space if he just needs to get away. I just wish that I could do more. How can I help him, reddit?\n\nTL;DR:",

I haven't even spoken to another girl since then until recently. I met someone who is shaping up to be absolutely amazing and i've never, ever had this much in common with anyone. Not even my close friends. I'd hesitate to use the word perfect as nobody is perfect but she could just be perfect for *me*.\n\nNow we get to the bad part. When my last relationship fell apart, my life did too. I gained 9 stone, 4 of which i've managed to lose in the last few months. I became incredibly depressed and contemplated taking my own life on several occasions. I didn't handle it well at all. I absolutely hated myself. Words cannot describe the resentment I felt when I looked in the mirror.\n\nIt was as if every little problem i'd ever had culminated into one giant one and weighed me down entirely. I didn't have a life for several years and never even saw my friends or family for over 2. I made the conscious decision that i'd never, ever put my self in a position where I could get that hurt again as I slowly started to pick up the pieces of my life.\n\nFour months ago I went on anti-depressants and things felt better, most of the time that is. I started exercising, I started losing weight. I started to realise that I was a bit lonely and I wanted to explore relationships again.  \n\nLittle did I know i'd meet someone who is a perfect match for me. Now i'm full of fear & doubt. So many negative questions flood my mind. Sometimes when she compliments me I feel it inside. The little voice that tells me i'm worthless and shouldn't listen to what she says. Other times I feel on top of the World, like nothing can bring me down.\n\nI'm confused. I'm feeling vulnerable and undeserving of happiness and I was just wondering if anyone had any advice to help me come to terms with whats going on. Everything has been going right lately but I still feel down. Life has only just started getting better, I couldn't bear to see the lights get shut off for another 4 years.\n\nTL;DR:",

He has close to 15k saved up so far. \n\nI have never had a job up until this summer. I live with a single dad and three other siblings so money is very tight. I am the eldest out of my siblings so it's only my dad and I who work. \n\nOn the very first date I went with my boyfriend, I had offered to pay for my movie ticket. He insisted that I don't have to. He said the same thing for the next couple of movie dates. He even said \"dinner is on me\" on several occasions even though I insisted I could pay for my half of the food\/ticket. \n\nMoving along, throughout the entire relationship (thus far) he has paid for me since I didn't have any source of income. We even share a Netflix account for $8.99. I have been keeping track of how much I owe him so I could pay him back as soon as I got a job. It's about $150 (including Netflix). So far I have paid him back $50 in small amounts of money. \n\nNow, the problem is that today he demanded that he needs the money and I pay him back asap. I told him that I'll give him the money back in small instalments and not all at once as I have other responsibilities. He then went on and said he wants all the money from the start (including all the tickets\/foods that he insisted I don't pay for...lol wtf. Why would you tell me in the first place to not pay at all if you wanted the money back). He then went on and started questioning me if I will ever pay him back... I told him I will and I have even been keeping track of how much I owe him (he's seen the list).\n\nTL;DR:",

Since then, I have undergone massive personal change, to the point that I almost feel like a completely different person than who I was when I dated him. \n\nThe relationship was very emotional right off the bat, as I was only a month out of a nearly 5 year long abusive relationship. He remains the nicest guy I have met to date, and he helped me and supported me as I went through dealing with my issues left over from the abusive relationship. I was his first real, long term girlfriend. We ended up living together that summer, and also spent three and a half months traveling through Australia with his friend and his friend's sister. During our relationship we talked about children and marriage, and I found myself thinking about looking at rings and him proposing.\n\nI made a lot of promises to him that I shouldn't have, because throughout the entire relationship I always knew in the back of my mind it wouldn't be forever. He would voice his fear that I would leave him during or after our trip to Australia, and I, without hesitation, promised him I wouldn't. I know I absolutely devastated him when I ended the relationship.\n\nNow, in my new place in life, I feel like I owe him an apology. I know I used him as a very drawn-out rebound, reveling in the security and love he provided. I feel like I should own up to the pain I caused him, and I want to wish him well. \n\nIs this a good idea? Should I let sleeping dogs lie? He and his best friend (our travel buddy) only recently deleted me from facebook - up until November we still retained that modicum of contact. Since finding out he deleted me, I've found myself thinking often of the hurt I caused him, and I legitimately hope he is happy now. I have no idea what kind of person he is now and I haven't seen him since the break up, so I don't know how any contact from me would be received.\n\nTL;DR:",

This is something that I had done before I met her, and I felt like it was time to be more open with her and let her know this side of me if we were going to move forward.\n When I told her I wouldn't she freaked out, but she got very confused and upset. We have had multiple long talks about this and she is worried about me changing. She has told me how she wants the me she fell in love with, not someone that she doesn't know. She is most scared of me saying I want to become a women even though I say I don't.\nWe have made some progress, she is okay with me wearing panties around her and even finds it mildly attractive. However, she is convinced if I am given a free range I will change into something that is not \"her guy\". \nI believe this is an issue of her not being able to trust me, even though she does in everything else, which is frustrating to me. She also would like me to experiment with everything possibly feminine so I can find out what I want and then she will decide if she's okay with that. This is were I get very frustrated as its not possible to systematically eliminate all things that she might not be okay with, and hurts because she doesn't trust me.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for wanting her to trust me on this? I know I can't give her a definite guarantee, and I love her so much I would give it all for her (she doesn't want me to do that because she wants me to me).\n\nTL;DR:",

Need advice\nPOST: Ok so a bit of back story, my fiancee have been together 6 years.  We have one 3 year old daughter together. We have had serious problems the last year.  I found out she cheated on me with a coworker (March 2015). I've never been unfaithful to her,  but I'm not perfect by any means. I don't believe I was being a good partner to her.. Not that it's any excuse to cheat. \n\nThe problem is we never went to counseling or anything, never really talked about it other than maybe that first week after I found out about it. She has a lot of depression and anxiety issues. We Co parent great,  our sex life is good,  we don't argue really. She just shuts down sometimes and gives up so  to speak.\n\n Two days ago she tells me she just can't do it anymore. She feels hopeless etc. She is a stay at home mom now and money is tight for us with one income which has also caused issues. She says she loves me with all her heart but isn't in love like she was. \n\nAnd I know this all sounds like she's cheating again but I honestly don't think so. Should I let her leave,  try to get to counseling? Just don't know what to do. Sorry for the long rambling post.\n\nTL;DR:",

I guess that is what really messes me up. it was in an earlier post if you want the details  \n\n It sucks cause i've been going out alot, having great times, talking to new women, reconnecting with old friends and just pretty much forget everything else that has happened. But still even after all of this i can't stop thinking about her. \n\nI already know the basic advice im going to get. And yea i have done it.

I was inlove and I had to break it off. Even though i didnt really want to, i just had to cause it wasn't healthy. \n\nMaybe it's cause im at all time low in confidence, i keep myself busy but still get a little free time now and then and she pops up, maybe its cause i havent gotten any other womens attention. and the ones i have, have not come close to her on looks. Not to be shallow but i would like another good looking girl thats all over me and begging for me back. It just makes me think that i mightve messed up. I just need somethoughts and advice. \n\nIf you'd like to read up on it more, click the link to my older post. It was a horrible relationship i know.

Here goes.\n\nQuick info: Me:19 out of school, working full time. Her: 18, still in school.\n\nI have been with my current girlfriend for about two months, and recently I just started noticing some ever growing self esteem issues. I've known her for around 6 months and I've heard her throw the occasional \"This makes me look fat.\" or \"I look terrible today!\" out, but nothing more than that. \n\nNow that we're dating, she is constantly saying how fat she is (She is far from it) and how she is going to start starving herself. She also talks about how she desires breast implants, a butt reduction and a tummy tuck. She's constantly speaking of killing herself because she's \"So fucking hideous and disgusting.\" I constantly try to reassure her that she is beautiful and lovely, but she never wants to hear it.\n\nI am assuming these feelings are feelings she has kept to herself as we've known one another and now has allowed to them to be heard because she has gotten comfortable. I do my best to compliment her and make her feel beautiful like she is, but it doesn't seem to be working. At this point it has begun to show in her personality and every day mood, she seems like she's lost some of the energy in her and happiness, which truly concerns me.\n\nReddit, what can I do to help my girlfriend out? She's a great person and is truly beautiful inside and out, now how can I get her to start believing this? I am strongly against self hate and I will not allow it to be a part of my relationship. Does anyone have any tips on how to make her feel as beautiful as she truly is?\n\nTL;DR:",

She is smart (all AP classes, passes all of them with 80 or higher) but she just can't seem to understand the concept of not having sex. I have been avoiding seeing her lately because, well...

I'm very tired.\n\nMy boyfriend and I don't live together, but we have been dating for 4 years. 2 years of that was long distance. When we're awake, he is very affectionate and kind. He likes to hold me, and kiss me and be close. We often spend Sundays cuddled on the couch, watching movies\/youtube videos. I like his affection a lot.\n\nAt night though... he often wakes me up by grabbing my tits and ass. Often times, I'll wake up to him grinding his hard dick against me, either my hip or my ass. Sometimes, it is actually painful. Sometimes he'll have this junk out of his boxers. Sometimes he'll put my hand on his junk. A lot of the time, precum gets all over my sheets, comforter, and my clothes. This doesn't happen every night, but it happens more often than not. I don't think the issue is that we're not having enough sex. He's usually at my place from Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, and we'll have sex anywhere from 3-5 times, *plus I'll give him 2-3 blow jobs.*\n\nI've talked to him about this, about how sometimes he hurts me while he's grinding against me. How it wakes me up, and really messes with my sleep schedule. I get very little sleep usually, due to my stressful job. I average at about 5-4 hours, and use the weekends to try to catch up. Him waking me up really cuts back on my weekend sleep. He always seems to contrite and sad when I bring it up, he apologizes and then tries to make it up to me... but then it happens again. I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I fix it?\nPOST: Backstory, I am moving out for the first time, spent some time home saving up money and all that good stuff. I've never had a roommate. I have no idea what this all entails, but I assume(d) that the general rules of relationships would apply. My Roommate is a friend(yes, I know...\"she won't be your friend after living together\") However, her anxiety and personal issues have resulted in some issues....\n\n    Having my boyfriend over, for example. We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room. I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month. She also does not want my friends over, ever.\n\n    I originally had plans to move in on Thursday\/Friday, however due to last minute plans, I had to switch to Friday\/Sunday. This resulted in us being there together Sunday. I was met with stomping everywhere she went and silence to any questions I asked....She is now saying that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    What have I gotten myself in to??? How can I navigate this to come to a compromise with someone so unwilling? I'm already stuck with this, since the lease is signed. I just need a way to make the best of it.\n\nTL;DR:",

During this time he cheated on her with numerous women and manipulated her by telling her it was all in her mind and that it was all her fault that she didn't trust him.\n\nFinally, she took my advice on board and ended that toxic relationship when Patrick cheated on her with someone that she knew. The girl he cheated on Ella with was really apologetic because she had no idea Ella even existed and only found out because she was telling her good friend (Tam) who was also good friends with Ella and Tam recognized the name immediately.\n\nAfter the breakup she found out some pretty devastating news about him that explained why the whole relationship was so toxic. Patrick is bipolar and often goes for periods of time without taking his medication.\n\nElla has been having a pretty hard time letting go and on a couple of occasions her and Patrick have hooked up. The other week at his place she noticed him texting another girl (Rose). Ella told me about it and I never really thought about it until today when my friend texted to say her friend Rose was dating Patrick.\n\nI immediately told Ella. She told me if she had been in the situation where she could have found out about him before she would have wanted to know so that she could've avoided that situation altogether. And that she's happy for Rose to contact her if that is what Rose wants.\n\nJust making it clear that she wouldn't tell Rose that Patrick is bipolar because he is pretty private about it and hasn't told many people.\n\nI really need advice on how to approach this. I know Rose but not well enough to hit her with this kind of information and I don't want to involve our mutual friend. I'm also worried that she'll think I'm lying to her since he comes across as such a great person.\n\nTL;DR:",

She lives with her daughter (who looks to be in her 50's) and her son-in-law, and they leave her there all day every day by herself. She takes her walker and goes on about an hour to walk to the end of our street (a 2 minute walk at most) and back, but more often than not she doesn't remember which house is hers, so she comes to ours. More than once we've come home and she's sitting by our front door on her walker, or we'll look out our window and she'll be walking towards our house. Our houses look nothing alike. We've always done our best to help her out, she tried to get into my car thinking it was her daughters car, and we've had to convince her that she didn't have to feed the cattle (we live in a neighbourhood by a school). But today, we found out that she was sitting in a car parked way back in their driveway with all of the windows up and a winter sweater and hat on for a few hours and it was sweltering hot. We had to convince her to go inside, all the while she was telling us she was waiting for her daughter. It's now almost 8pm and no one has been home since early this morning. If we hadn't been there, she would probably still be sitting in the car waiting for them. What is also scary, is that we knew she was there because we heard the dinging of the door, because the keys were in the ignition. What do we do? We're afraid for her safety, what if she tries to make food and turns on the oven and forgets? Our other neighbour tried to tell her daughter once, but she doesn't seem to listen\/care.\n\nTL;DR:",

We are currently in a semi-long distance relationship (1 hour away) because she goes to school in LA (her hometown is 6 hours away from me). I drive to visit once a week and my mom was starting to get a little angry because she says it's a waste of gas and I should only visit her once every 2 weeks.\n\nIn addition, my parents had two conditions for me to stay with her (1. She converts to Catholicism and 2. She agrees to move to southern California if we get married). Now my mother told me that I had to ask this right away before things get hard on me later. \n\nI personally don't care if she converts or not because I respect her own beliefs and I know that she respects mine. However, I really love my family and it made my mom sad at the thought of me possibly moving far away from her in the future and that she is of a different religion. I know that she is scared that I will get hurt because a long distance relationship is pretty risky but I really love this girl. My gf is really easy to talk to and really makes me happy. I have never met someone that clicks with me like her and I know that she feels the same way. The thought of us ending without closure makes me sad and I do not want to give up. \n\nMy gf said that she does not want to convert and that she does not want to be tied down on where to live in the future. She believes in just seeing where life takes her. \n\nI know my mom will get over the religion thing but I do not know how she will handle me possibly leaving my hometown in the future. I really do not want to end this relationship but at the same time I am scared because my parents will be disappointed in me if it messes up and I get hurt. \n\nI guess I am asking for some advice... Should I keep trying this relationship out and see what happens? Or should I just give up and move on.\n\nTL;DR:",

I would love for him to find something else, but he feels like he any job that he would get would be exactly the same. He has issues with anxiety, and filling out job applications causing him so much stress that he seems to shut down. I try to motivate him to find something he likes, or anything that will be different from his current situation, but it's almost like he sees no hope in anything. \n\nI want to be supportive, I listen to all of the problems he has at work, and I offer suggestions to make it more bearable. I'm also doing my best to present him with other places in town that he could apply to. His unhappiness at work is affecting him so much at home that I just want him to be able to quit this job and find something else.

We dated for four months before she called time on it in January because she \"wanted to be alone\" and by herself for the last few months of our last year of University (although she followed this up by saying she would probably \"regret\" her decision in a few weeks and that I was \"the best\" boyfriend she'd ever had, great closure, huh?).\n\nI understand all her reasoning behind it, the last year being stressful and to add a relationship onto that would be extra tough. However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted \"No Contact\" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting\/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party\/gathering with her and have everything rush back.\n\nI'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.\n\nI don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly. I was thinking of inviting her to have lunch at a neutral location (a cafe on campus or similar) and talking to her there.\n\nSo, the crux of the matter is what do I say and how do I go about it? I don't want her to feel like its her fault or that I'm going to ignore her \/ be a dick about it. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

What can I do?\nPOST: So, long story short, we've been together more than 15 years, married for 10, no kids yet, and we love to travel. We've always traveled kind of thriftily, but I was planning a 10 Year Balls-to-the-Wall something or other until we got a little bad news: she needs back surgery, and she needs it fairly quickly. I started working to move my plans up on the calendar, no matter what the changes cost me, but then I found out that she's on strict orders not to travel while awaiting surgery. FML.\n\nHer recovery time will be a small number of months, but in the mean time I'd like to commemorate the date with something a little more special than a really nice dinner, etc. To make matters more complicated, the surgery is only a few days after our anniversary date and it's happening in another city (Houston), so we'll be several hundred miles from most of our friends and all of our family except for her parents.\n\nAnd I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've looked into getting some of our friends to come down and have some sort of a party, but I couldn't get anywhere with that for a variety of reasons (not least of which was the aforementioned hundreds of miles of travel). I've rescheduled our whirlwind trip for as soon as she can reasonably be expected to be capable of travel, but that won't be for several months.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

It went really well, and I liked her a lot. She told me from the start that she was married and in an open relationship, and I wasn't phased by that really. I think that I didn't care because I hadn't fully thought through what it would mean to \"date\" someone in an open relationship. \n\nSo now that I'm about to go on a second date with her, I'm freaking out a little about how I'm expected to act. Do I treat her like any other girl I'd date and say cute things and let myself have feelings for her? Or do I try to avoid that and treat it as a sexual relationship only? On the first date, we ended up making out a lot, and I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to invite her back to my place or whether it was too soon, so I said goodnight. I guess this time I invite her back? And then it's just sexual from here out? I've had meaningless sex with guys and that's easy enough, but I'm worried I might not be able to separate feelings with a girl, because they make my heart go pitter patter. Any insight?\n\nTL;DR:",

I am also far from spontaneous. Hell, I cannot even choose dinner because I only care to get her what she wants. She always wishes I would take her out on a date or dinner, but it just never crosses my mind, not because of how much I care, but just because I am not any type of person who can actively make plans...\n\n Anyone else in this situation can give me a hand before I lose one of the best things I have had due to my stubborn and seemingly callous nature?\n\nTL;DR:",

Fast forward through awkward flirting and such while we eat and drink for about an hour, checks come, I leave her a note saying I thought she was cute and that I would love to buy her a drink sometime with my number.\n\nYesterday I went back to that sports bar after I hadn't heard from her. Different group of people but turns out she is our server again. She says she remembers me so I call her by her name and have a good meal. This time when the checks came, I grabbed my card and I shut my book. This morning when I woke up, I realized I forgot to fill out the tip portion of my bill.

So many mixed emotions.\n\nI've been dating a lovely girl for about 2.5 years. She is quite attractive, much smarter than I am, and oh so sweet. Unfortunately, we're long distance, and we'll remain long distance for at least another year.\n\nLast night, a girl I know basically propositioned me for sex. I came THIS close to telling her yes, come over, please. This girl is local, lives right up the street from me. She's the type of girl I've always been strongly attracted to (the manic pixie dream girl type, I suppose) but have never actually dated. Ultimately, I did NOT invite her up. But afterwards, I tossed and turned in bed all night.\n\nI feel guilty, for even considering cheating; I feel regret at missing out on what probably would've been a really fun night -- coupled with a sort of deeper melancholy I feel when I consider all the girls I'll *never* know; I feel relief, at not having cheated; I feel sad about what this surely must say about the state of my relationship; and honestly, I don't know which of these emotions I'm feeling most strongly. (To tell you the truth, things *have* been tough lately. Long distance is hard, to begin with, and my significant other is leaving the country for a few months and we'll have even LESS contact; she has been clinically depressed for a while now, and doesn't seem to be getting better, and it's getting harder to deal with; and realistically, we'll probably be long distance for another 1.5 years, best case scenario).\n\nThanks for reading. I'm not sure that I really have a question -- I mainly just wanted to get this off my chest. Your thoughts are certainly welcome, though.\n\nTL;DR:",

I learned then that he only brushed his teeth a couple times a week. I was horrified, and over a the next few months, I pestered him to brush his teeth more often. Eventually, he got up to brushing his teeth most days. Many months later and more pestering, he was brushing daily, flossing a couple times per week, and usually using mouthwash.\n\nBut lately I've been noticing it again. I can smell his breath from a few feet away. It's gross to kiss him. I've had to interrupt foreplay a few times and ask him to go brush. Sometimes I outright refuse to kiss him until he brushes. He's always annoyed and a bit mad when I do that, but in my opinion, he should know by now that he needs to brush his damn teeth.\n\nI feel like this is ridiculous; I shouldn't have to tell him several times a week to brush his teeth.

For the longest time, I felt that I had it under control. In school, my condition was misunderstood and I was ridiculed by my peers as well as my teachers. I overcame and found a nice job. I was laid off because of the recession and took up a job with a certain job with a certain game-related company. I tried my best to excel at my job, to the point where I became the Go-To-Guy for information on technical resolutions and policy matters. \n\nToday, I was demoted because my narcolepsy sometimes gets the better of me and I miss work. I cannot afford medical insurance nor the medicine to make it less of an issue ($500 for a month's supply). I was told that the ADA did not apply because attendance was a hard requirement for being a higher level agent. Our HR person told me that any job I get will have a requirement about attendance and that the ADA will never side with me. I am forced to assume an entry level position in a job I used to love. I feel as though my hard work will never pay off now, because my narcolepsy will also stop me from advancing and that ADA does not apply to me. \n\nI still feel like I'm being discriminated against but if what HR told me is true then I do believe that any career I take will be hampered by this condition, which cannot be cured. \n\nPlease, tell me there are options. I feel as though I'm about to slip into a state of depression that I had left behind me so long ago. I don't want to be there. Please, tell me that there is hope.\n\nThrowaway account for obvious reasons..\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been together since last September, and met when we were living in the dorms as freshmen in August. He's my best friend and we do everything together, practically living together save for the 3 months of summer. But lately, my heart hasn't been in our relationship. We have sex considerably less and even if I'm aroused, I would rather just be alone. I've been seeking more time apart and crave time without him far more than I have before. Right now, we are in our respective homes during Christmas break (we're from different states), and I know I should be missing him, but I'm just... not. \n\nI've talked to him about the possibility of having an open relationship or going on \"break\", but he hates that idea because he says he loves me and doesn't want to give me up or see anyone else. He fights my every argument, and doesn't understand how I could feel this way when our relationship is \"perfect\".  Now, this is my first serious relationship, so I'm new to this too. I don't know how to go about the way I'm feeling or even if I decide to break up with him, how to do that without destroying our friendship? I can't imagine just severing ties with him.

(UK 14-15), so it's difficult to buy nice shoes that aren't for working on building sites. I buy them online, and I usually buy two or three pairs to see me through for at least a few months. I last bought shoes 12 months ago. \n\nAnyway, I pull them out this morning, and place them upon my bedroom floor, when it occurs to me that they're not exactly what I was hoping for. They were both for my left foot. Not a problem, I thought, dig deeper into the cupboard, and the right will be found. Was it fuck. I had the entire wardrobe out, and couldn't find a right shoe anywhere. I then spent an hour ringing around shoe shops in my relatively local area, asking if they did smart shoes in a size 15. No, they didn't. \n\nI was there, in a room full of suited guys, dressed in a shirt with dark jeans and bright white basketball trainers on....

While I'm assigned to work on various projects by my manager, part of my time is allowed for the development of my own self-initiated projects so long as they can be used to help the company in the future. My co-worker who has the same set up and whose assigned work is often for the same projects as the ones I work on recently switched to working part-time so that he can have more time to develop his own self-initiated projects. This is great, and I'm happy for him except I've noticed a slow creep in my workload increasing as a result. It's nothing drastic so far, but I'm slowly becoming the person others default to in terms of making requests, asking me to attending meetings, etc. because the my co-worker is now not available part of the week and protects his time off by not answering email, etc. on days when he's out. As a result, my time spent on self-initiated projects is starting to decrease. \n\nHow do I talk to my manager about my concerns over the slow creep of my co-worker's former work into my workload? Even though my co-worker informed me he was switching to part-time, our manager never discussed this fact with me at all or what it means for me. I'm also not really sure what he can say given that there is no one else with similar expertise that can take the burden and our company only hires in April. We work in high enough demand positions where I can easily leave and get a new job if someone were to tell me to just suck it up and take it, but I'd really not resort to that. I just want to have a non-threatening conversation with my manager that at the same time allows me to stand up for myself and protect my time on self-initiated projects but I don't know what to say.\n\nTL;DR:",

One of my old buddies kind of went crazy (too many hallucinogenic drugs) and he became super lazy. He stopped taking his dog outside to go to bathroom, so the guest room became the dog's poop and piss room. My friend also decided it was too much work to take the trash out to the dumpster so he started throwing the full trash bags into the poop and piss room too.\n\nEventually his power got shut off because he wasn't working or paying bills. This was in the middle of summer in Alabama. Needless to say the apartment became super hot and the fleas from his dog multiplied at an alarming rate. My friend eventually left, but didn't bring his dog with him.\n\nMy other friend and I had to go save the dog from the hell hole apartment. When we walked in, we were instantly covered in fleas up to our shins. It was terrifying! We grabbed the dog and ran. Not sure what ended up happening to the apartment, but I'm sure the people who cleaned it had to go in with haz-mat suits on haha.\n\nMy friend, whose jeep we used to rescue the dog, had to live with a new problem; his jeep got infested with fleas. He tried everything he could think of and eventually just had to set off bug bombs in his jeep. That jeep smelled like death for months after that.\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been dating for about 4 months now, although we have been close friends for 3 years prior to dating. During these 4 months, we've had good times but we have noticed that we argue a lot. They're not usually arguments about big things but generally just many arguments about small things.\n\nFirstly, I admit that I am a person who is a bit quick to anger and I tend to get annoyed by small things. I am aware that this is a problem and have been consciously trying to correct such a bad trait. It's not at an extreme level where I get ticked off at everything, but things like when she decides to, for example, see her friends over seeing me after she has been away for a month sort of ticks me off.\n\nWe end up arguing over things like that and it happens way too frequently. I'd say we average an argument almost every week and I know it can't be healthy for our relationship. I really want to make things work between us but I really don't know how to approach it.\n\nI'm here, requesting advice on how to make everything better. I've grown tired of arguing over small things because I know it cannot be good. I do not mind if I have to do all the work and change myself so that I don't get annoyed so easily, as long as I know how to approach it. Please help.\n\nTL;DR:",

We live together and he has made a huge decision he just expects me to be OK with.\nPOST: SO my boyfriend and I have been living together, for 6 months now. We both work in the food industry and hes planning on going back to school in 2 weeks. \n\nA little background on our jobs, its important to our disagreement. I am a salary manager in a very popular corporation and he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks. \n\nNow I wouldnt mind so much if we were in a better economic state. I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. \n\nMy question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?\n\nTL;DR:",

I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. \n\nBasically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting.

Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.\n\nShould I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my \"first\" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. \n\nI'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer.

I'll ask her out and get turned down because her parents won't let her, she has work, she has uni or she's with other friends, to the point where I've stopped trying.\n\nPart of the issue is me, because I'm too spiteful and refuse to be the one always asking. I asked two friends out to lunch today and just didn't bother asking my own girlfriend, simply because there was like an 80% chance she'd say no for whatever reason and I'd get pissed off.\n\nI tried to break up with her a few months ago for the same reason, really, and I've had words with her about it since too. I know she cares, I know that I mean a lot to her and she doesn't want to lose me...but she just doesn't show it at all [when she's not with me]. When we're together everything is really good, great even. We have heaps of fun and clearly love each other's company. But once we part ways, it might be for the whole week despite us living like a 20 minute drive away, and 90% of the time we'll only see each other if I keep asking.\n\nI've had this issue for a while but have told myself I'll wait until the end of August since by then we'll have had a few weeks with her parents out of the picture to see if the relationship actually changes, but I don't know if I can even hang in that much longer. I asked her to come over on Thursday since I hadn't seen her for a week and had been away - she was going to be at work that night and my place is closer than hers from there - but no, she was \"too tired\" to stay with me.\n\nSince I've brought it up before and nothing's really changed, should I even go through the same speech again? I want to love this girl but I just spend so much of my time being pissed off.\n\nTL;DR:",

More info inside...\nPOST: We are both in High School yet, and when my ex boyfriend (Lets call him \"Randy\") and I started dating in mid September this last year, 2011. We were together a little over a month, so through October, but during that time he was extremely pushy about everything, and with everything. He couldnt keep his hands to himself, and was abusive physically and verbally. We would be sitting in the park nearby my house, and he would push me down onto the picnic, pin me there, and run his hands up my shirt and down my pants. I had a curfew to  be home by, and wouldnt care, he'd keep me pinned on the table grinding his nasty body against mine. I would tell him I didnt want this to happen, that I wasnt comfortable, and he told me that if I didnt go along with it that he would spread word around that I was sleeping with all these different guys, that I was smokin' it up everyday, that I cheated on my past boyfriends with someone else, etc. So naturally I was scared to say anything against what he \"wanted to do.\"  Along with pinning me down, he would take my hand and force me to give him a handjob and would try to thrust my head down to give him a blowjob as well. \n\nThis happened on numerous occasions...I feel so guilty right now for not laying down ground rules and boundaries, and Im full of regret that had anything to do with him. \nWhat scares me though is that this all happened in September-October 2011, and I just filed sexual harrassment against him last month or so. The reason I waited so long was because I was afraid to talk about it to anybody, I was constantly angry so I distanced myself from people. Until I finally opened up to one of my closest friends about what he did, and she suggested I file sexual assault.\nSo now I have to write a victim impact statement, and I was wondering if Reddit had any tips for doing that?

He tells me I need to get over it, but gets jealous when I vape because a male friend gave me a unit (when I use his I hear the sound and get upset because I remember it). I just didn't want him to do it because I thought \"what happens if it's not enough\"? It would just be a gateway for him to do other things, and since he was previously using a lot of drugs I get really worried.\n\nI don't know if I am being too unreasonable.

It's been several years since then, but he at first told me that they never had sex in the year they kept living together. Then he came out and told me they had sex everyday and he was high most of the time living with her, trying \"everything but meth\".\n\nI have gotten over it in some way by saying \"it was the drugs, it's not entirely his fault\". I am addicted to smoking and trying to quit, so I started vaping. I told him I didn't want him to do it too because it bothered me because I was worried he would do it as an escapist thing and it made me think about that past situation. I caught him doing it by the sound via skype and got really upset with him. He tells me I need to get over it, but gets jealous when I vape because a male friend gave me a unit (when I use his I hear the sound and get upset because I remember it). I just didn't want him to do it because I thought \"what happens if it's not enough\"? It would just be a gateway for him to do other things, and since he was previously using a lot of drugs I get really worried.\n\nI don't know if I am being too unreasonable. I just don't know how to get over it and it's killing me. I know it has nothing to do with me, but the fact that he was able to do something like that just drives me crazy. I don't know how to cope with this, but I do want to be with him. We are trying to have a longterm relationship and I have met all his family. I don't know if I am the fucked up one.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm currently thinking of buying an electric razor, but, could someone who is a bit more experienced in shaving give me some advice on what to buy?\nPOST: I grew up with my mom.  When I hit the age where I started growing facial hair, she bought me a razor (one like [this] and some shaving cream, and I just kind of figured out the rest.\n\nI generally shave after my hot shower (I believe it opens the pours or something).  I cover my face in gell\/foam and go with the grain then against the grain.

I have no hair above my lip or on my neck.  Once the beard gets a bit too long, I'll just shave it all off and start over because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.\n\nI was thinking about buying an electric razor because:\n\n1.  I'm under the impression I can do a quick once-over on my face every day, keeping myself relatively clean shaven, or, if I can pull it off, with just a thin layer of stubble (which I hear the ladies like).\n\n2.  It would be cheaper than buying razor heads.\n\n3.  They don't give razor burn, which, I get on my neck frequently if I shave more than once every four days (which sucks because I get a faint neck beard that I feel looks unattractive).\n\nSo yeah...

His Dad says I am a lot like her, and wants his son and I to get married so badly. One day, probably 8 months ago, his Dad showed me his wife's wedding ring and we talked about their wedding\/marriage, etc.\n\nSo I've seen the ring multiple times, I think it's beautiful, and my boyfriend's Dad told him to keep it in his drawer because his Dad is a crazy old man and thinks he will misplace it. My boyfriend had been trying to \"throw me off the scent\" (which I didn't know until later) by saying when he proposes, he's not sure yet if he will use his Mom's ring or a new one. So, naturally, I didn't think it mattered if I saw the ring a few times, or talked about other rings.\n\nI told my best friend about him potentially proposing with his Mom's ring and she thinks it's sweet but that I should have my own since we are \"our own relationship\". I disagree, but she makes an interesting point, so I bring up her point to my boyfriend to get his thoughts (thinking that maybe that's why he is considering using a different ring).\n\nWell shit. My boyfriend gets all upset and says that I wouldn't have brought this new-ring idea to him if I didn't think I should have my own, and that I should know how much the ring means to him and his family, and now half the surprise is ruined because I'll be mad if he gets a new ring (thinking it would be out of spite) but I won't be surprised if I see his mom's ring.\n\nSo, I effectively ruined a future proposal... innocently, but still.\n\nTL;DR:",

Fast forward to when she actually broke up with him. She went through a long period before we had begun dating, and during this time it was sketchy at best. We were not dating but had been involved and were considering dating soon. A week before I asked her to be my girlfriend (4 months of being together unofficially) she meets up with a random mutual friend and gets drunk and fucks him. She says she didnt know they would when they were drunk, but thats rediculous because I talked to him and he said they planned to have sex for a long time. (This isn't a huge problem because we werent dating but still concerns me). Did she do this to get it out of the way because she knew she would soon be \"committed?\" She is completely anal about me not talking or even looking in the general direction of a girl whom she thinks I like, however, she can hang out, alone, til 4 in the morning, while we're dating, with a guy she has fucked before. My real question is, am I encroaching on relationship boundaries by asking her to stop hanging out with him?

What do you consider landmarks? When did they happen?\n\nWe spend most of our time at my place for convenience and he seems to fit in to my home nicely. He is comfortable making breakfast or doing dishes and has offered to help with other chores if I happen to need to do them when he's over. So far I've turned down his offer to help with other chores, but I do appreciate the gesture.\n\nI have a history of moving in too soon, so I know I need to wait QUITE a while before I ever even consider that move. Like, over a year. At least. I just don't know how the rest of it should\/could play out. I do expect some widely varied answers, so any details as to why you think it was good timing\/later than normal\/sooner than normal would be much appreciated.\n\nWe started farting around each other almost immediately.

Could you give me some advice?\nPOST: Hey Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend of approximately a year and a half told me last night that her mother has cancer. She gave me very few details, as it was over the phone and she was pretty upset, but she did happen to say that there is a high rate of success if treated early with chemo. I've met both of her parents, and they are wonderful and generous people. Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to approach her and provide the right kind of emotional support. I've been very lucky so far in my life, not having gone through a situation like this with a loved one so close to me, but I think that's put me at a disadvantage in terms of knowing how to connect to my girlfriend now. My dad is an existentialist, and I share his mindset to some extent, so I'm really not the best at providing emotional support. I'm also a staunch atheist, and she's one the fence, so I want to be very careful not to interject my thoughts at a time when she might be turning to something I don't believe in. She's an amazing and beautiful girl, and I want to find a way to be more helpful through this process. Does anyone have suggestions about what to say on a daily basis, and maybe how to treat things through the longer term? Don't be afraid to point out the obvious, I don't want to miss anything. \n\nThis is a throwaway account, as you can see from my history and obvious lack of kharma. My close friends know my username and that I'm often on here, and given the nature of the situation, I don't want them knowing about this.

It's a class of maybe 30 students. I (and quite a few of the other folks in my class) have found it increasingly difficult to concentrate, however, due to one individual. This guy is a non-traditional student. He sits in the front of the room every day, but there's always a small ring of empty seats around him because he has serious personal hygiene issues. B.O. combined with the smell of a pack's worth of cigarette smoke emanates from his body.\n\nTo make matters worse, it seems that he has some sort of autism. He'll rock back and forth in his seat during class which is both visually (he sits in the front) and audibly distracting (the seats creak).\n\nThe cherry on the cake, however, is that for long stretches of class he will breathe exclusively through his mouth. I have no idea whether this is a health-related issue or a psychological thing, but his breathing is loud enough to make it hard to hear the (albeit soft-spoken) professor.\n\nWhat do I do, Reddit? These seem like issues that shouldn't really exist, but can anything be done?\n\nTL;DR:",

Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a \"BANG BANG\" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass. Along with having to go to that class tommrow I know for a fact my teacher is going to question me and im gonna get a call from the therapist. Also could this have any kind of long term affect on me?\n\nTL;DR:",

We all came from different parts of the country to do the same thing, so naturally our shared experience made us all pretty close friends. Well, a few nights ago, we're all out as a group (about 50 of us), getting tanked and listening to live music. The night takes us all our seperate ways and with our seperate smaller groups of friends. I end up with one of my closest friends here and a few others. This girl is VERY attractive, I'd say out of my league. While I've always been attracted to her, it's never been like, something I've pursued because of the fact we work very closely together, and I genuinely just enjoy her company. Well... After a night fueled by fireball, friend and I end up drunkenly (very, very drunkenly) boning. \n\nthe next morning, we wake up, everything seems... Alright. We laugh it off, say everything is cool and that's that. Fast forward to that evening, our large group is out for a birthday party. Instantly I can tell things are awkward. She won't make eye contact with me, and we don't talk. At all. Which is weird. I make the rounds, say goodnight, and go home. \n\nWell, now it's the next morning and I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to salvage this situation.

I've been seeing a guy now for a few months. I met him right as I was getting out of a messy relationship that really fucked with my head. But he's made me so happy since I've started seeing him and I can really see a future with him. But we haven't yet talked about where we see this going. We've both said we aren't sleeping with other people, but we haven't yet said whether or not we want to be in a relationship. I'm having trouble bringing up the subject. Mostly because my last relationship ended so badly and it makes me nervous to let someone else in. I'm also worried that our age difference might be too much for him because every once in a while he'll make a joke about how young I am. \n\nI know that being scared to have this conversation seems stupid and most of you will probably think that I shouldn't be with someone I can't have this conversation with. But I guess I just can't decide if having this talk after only a couple months is rushing into something or if I'm going to sound crazy. I guess I just need a pep talk or something. Any advice is greatly appreciated\n\nTL;DR:",
